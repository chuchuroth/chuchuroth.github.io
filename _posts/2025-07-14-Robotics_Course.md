        *   Specific setup instructions for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
    *   **Allocating Resources**: Recommend at least **2 processor cores and 4 GB of RAM** for efficiency; more for better performance.
    *   **First Boot**: Choose keyboard layout; default password is `robo-nd`.
    *   **Common Questions**:
        *   Minimum specs for Windows 10: 2 GB RAM, 20 GB disk space, 4 logical cores.
        *   **Avoid VirtualBox** due to inferior 3D graphics capabilities for intensive applications.

**III. ROS Fundamentals: Nodes, Topics, and Services**
*   **A. Environment Setup**
    *   Ensuring ROS environment variables are present by **sourcing the setup script** (use `source` not `./`).
    *   Environment is automatically configured by adding the source command to `~/.bashrc`.
*   **B. Starting the Master Process (`roscore`)**
    *   **`roscore`** is responsible for naming, registration, tracking publishers/subscribers, aggregating log messages, and facilitating node connections. Terminate with `Ctrl-C`.
*   **C. Running Turtlesim Nodes**
    *   Utilize **`rosrun <package_name> <node_name>`** to execute nodes.
    *   Tips: Open new terminals with `Ctrl + Shift + T`, use tab completion.
    *   Launch `turtlesim_node` and `turtle_teleop_key` to control the virtual turtle.
*   **D. Turtlesim Communication Commands**
    *   **Listing all Active Nodes**: `rosnode list` shows nodes like `/rosout`, `/teleop_turtle`, `/turtlesim`.
    *   **Listing All Topics**: `rostopic list` shows topics like `/turtle1/cmd_vel` (velocity commands) and `/turtle1/pose` (position/orientation).
    *   **Get Information About a Specific Topic**: `rostopic info <topic_name>` shows publishers, subscribers, and message type (e.g., `geometry_msgs/Twist`).
    *   **Show Message Information**: `rosmsg info <message_type>` displays the structure of a message type. `rosed` can be used to view message definition files.
    *   **Echo Messages on a Topic**: `rostopic echo <topic_name>` displays messages in real-time.
*   **E. Catkin Packages and Workspaces**
    *   **ROS software is organized into packages** (directories with source code, libraries, build instructions, and `package.xml`).
    *   A **catkin workspace** is a top-level directory for building and modifying packages.
*   **F. Create a Catkin Workspace**
    *   **Steps**: `mkdir -p /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src`, `cd src`, `catkin_init_workspace`, `cd ..`, **`catkin_make`**.
    *   `catkin_make` creates `build` and `devel` directories; `devel` contains `setup.bash`.
*   **G. Cloning and Building Existing Packages (`simple_arm`)**
    *   Clone `simple_arm` from GitHub into `catkin_ws/src`.
    *   Build with `catkin_make`. Troubleshooting missing package errors (e.g., `controller_manager`) by installing system packages.
*   **H. `roslaunch`**
    *   Enables launching multiple nodes, setting parameters, and re-spawning processes with a single command. Requires built and sourced workspace.
*   **I. `rosdep`**
    *   Tool to check and install missing build and run dependencies for ROS packages.
*   **J. Dive Deeper into Packages (Creating Your Own)**
    *   **`catkin_create_pkg <your_package_name> [dependencies]`** creates a minimum working package.
    *   Overview of typical package directory structure (`scripts`, `src`, `msg`, `srv`, `launch`, etc.).
    *   Introduction to the `simple_mover`, `arm_mover`, and `look_away` C++ nodes.
*   **K. ROS Publishers (C++ Implementation)**
    *   Allows a node to send messages to a topic.
    *   Key function: **`ros::Publisher pub = n.advertise<message_type>("/topic_name", queue_size);`**. `n` is `NodeHandle`, `advertise()` registers publisher, `publish(msg)` sends data.
*   **L. Simple Mover Node (First C++ Node)**
    *   **Goal**: Command `simple_arm` joints to swing using sine waves.
    *   Publishes `std_msgs/Float64` messages to `/simple_arm/joint_1_position_controller/command` and `joint_2_position_controller/command` topics.
    *   **Implementation Steps**: Create `src` directory in `simple_arm`, then `simple_mover.cpp`.
    *   **Code Explanation**: Uses `ros::init`, `ros::NodeHandle`, `ros::Publisher`, `ros::Rate` for loop frequency, and `ros::Time` for elapsed time.
    *   **Build and Run**: Modify `CMakeLists.txt` to include necessary components and executable definitions. Build with `catkin_make`, then launch `simple_arm/robot_spawn.launch` and `simple_arm simple_mover`.
*   **M. ROS Services (C++ Implementation)**
    *   Enables request/response communication.
    *   **Server Creation**: **`ros::ServiceServer service = n.advertiseService("service_name", handler);`**. `.srv` files define request/response message types.
    *   **Client Usage**: `ros::ServiceClient client = n.serviceClient<package_name::service_file_name>("service_name");` and `client.call(srv);`. Services can also be called from command line using `rosservice call`.
*   **N. Arm Mover Node (Services, Parameters, Custom Messages)**
    *   Provides `safe_move` service for movement commands and uses ROS parameters for configurable joint limits.
    *   **Custom Service Definition**: Create `srv/GoToPosition.srv` with `float64 joint_1`, `float64 joint_2` (request) and `string msg_feedback` (response). (Similar to `.msg` files for custom message types).
    *   **Modify `CMakeLists.txt`**: Uncomment `add_service_files`, `generate_messages`, add `add_compile_options(-std=c++11)`.
    *   **Modify `package.xml`**: Ensure `message_generation` and `message_runtime` dependencies.
    *   **Code Explanation**: Uses global publishers, `handle_safe_move_request` callback for service, `clamp_at_boundaries` function (retrieves joint limits from **ROS Parameter Server**). Uses `ros::spin()` to handle communication events.
    *   **Build, Launch, Interact**: Modify `CMakeLists.txt` to add executable. Build with `catkin_make`. Modify `robot_spawn.launch` to include `arm_mover` node and its parameters. Test using `rosservice call` and `rosparam set`.
*   **O. ROS Clients and Subscribers (C++ Implementation)**
    *   **Clients**: Request services from service server nodes. Defined using `n.serviceClient<service_type>("service_name")`.
    *   **Subscribers**: Read messages from a topic. Defined using `n.subscribe("/topic_name", queue_size, callback_function);`. The `callback_function` processes incoming data.
*   **P. Look Away Node (Clients and Subscribers in Action)**
    *   Subscribes to camera image (`/rgb_camera/image_raw`) and joint states (`/simple_arm/joint_states`).
    *   If image is uniform (sky) and arm is not moving, it calls the `safe_move` service to re-center the arm.
    *   **Implementation**: Update `robot_spawn.launch` to include `look_away` node and adjust joint limits. Create `look_away.cpp`.
    *   **Code Explanation**: Uses a global `ServiceClient`, two `Subscriber` objects (`joint_states_callback` and `look_away_callback`), `move_arm_center` function to call the service.
    *   **Build, Launch, Interact**: Modify `CMakeLists.txt`. Build, launch, and interact by sending commands to the `safe_move` service.
*   **Q. Pub-Sub Class (Template)**
    *   Recommended practice to organize ROS publishers and subscribers within a C++ class to avoid global variables and improve code structure.

*   **J. Setting up `ball_chaser` Package**
    *   **Purpose**: Analyze camera image for white ball and drive robot towards it.

    *   **Evaluation and Submission**: Check Project Rubric, submit zipped `my_robot` and `ball_chaser` packages following specific directory structure.

**V. Localization: Kalman Filters and Bayes Filtering**
*   **A. 1D Gaussian**
    *   **Basis of Kalman Filter**: Outputs a unimodal Gaussian distribution (bell curve) as its best guess.
    *   A continuous probability function characterized by **mean (μ)** and **variance (σ²)**. The area under the curve always sums to one.
    *   Kalman Filter assumes noise is Gaussian for optimal performance.
*   **B. Kalman Filter: Measurement Update Formulas**
    *   **New Mean**: Weighted sum of prior belief and measurement means, biased towards the more confident (smaller variance) source.
    *   **New Variance**: The new state estimate is **more confident** (narrower) than either the prior or measurement alone.
    *   **Programming Quiz**: Implement `measurement_update` function to calculate posterior mean and variance.
    *   Iteratively apply measurement updates and state predictions.
*   **C. Multivariate Gaussians**
    *   For multi-dimensional systems (e.g., x & y position), multiple 1D Gaussians are insufficient due to potential **correlation** between dimensions.
    *   **Mean is a vector**, and variance is a **covariance matrix**.
    *   Formula for multivariate Gaussian involves vectors and matrices.
*   **D. Design of Multi-Dimensional Kalman Filters**
    *   Uses linear algebra.
    *   **State Prediction**:
        *   Mean: `x' = Fx` (F is State Transition Function).
        *   Covariance: **`P' = F P F^T + Q`** (Q is process noise covariance).
    *   **Measurement Update**:
        *   Measurement Function `H` maps state to observation `z`.
        *   Measurement residual: `y = z - Hx'`.
        *   `S = H P' H^T + R` (R is measurement noise covariance).
        *   **Kalman Gain**: `K = P' H^T S^-1` (determines weight on prediction vs. measurement).
        *   Posterior State: `x = x' + Ky`.
        *   Posterior Covariance: `P = (I - KH)P'`.
    *   **Summary**: Kalman Filter is for **linear motion and measurement functions**. For nonlinearities, the **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** linearizes the function around the mean.
*   **E. Multi-dimensional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**
    *   **Linearization**: Uses **multi-dimensional Taylor series** to approximate nonlinear functions with their first two terms.
    *   **Jacobian Matrix**: `Df(a)` or `H` contains **partial derivatives** (how each function component changes with each state variable).
    *   **Example Application**: Robot measures polar coordinates (`r`, `theta`) but state is Cartesian (`x`, `y`). The measurement function `h(x')` is nonlinear.
        *   The **Jacobian `H`** (derived from partial derivatives of `h(x)`) is used to update the state's covariance.
    *   **EKF Equations**: Modified Kalman Filter equations use `f(x)` for state prediction and `h(x')` for measurement residual, and **Jacobians `F` and `H` for covariance updates**.
    *   **Summary**: EKF is used when functions are nonlinear, involves iterative calculation of Jacobians.
    *   **EKF Example (Quadrotor)**: Demonstrates calculating the Jacobian `H` for a nonlinear rangefinder measurement model.
*   **F. Catkin Workspace Setup for EKF Lab**

    *   Notes on Udacity Workspace and native installation of ROS packages.
*   **I. Map Setup (Project 3)**
    *   **PGM Map File**: AMCL uses `pgm` (grayscale image) files; darker pixels = obstacle, lighter = free.
    *   **PGM Map Creator**: ROS package to generate maps from Gazebo worlds (best for vertical surfaces).
        *   Install dependencies, clone `pgm_map_creator`.
        *   Add plugin to your world file.
        *   Run `gzserver` and `request_publisher.launch` to create map. Adjust `xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax` if needed.
        *   Copy map to your package's `maps` folder and create a `.yaml` file with metadata.
*   **J. AMCL Package and Launch File**
    *   **AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)**: Dynamically adjusts particle count for computational efficiency.
    *   **`amcl.launch`**: Create launch file for AMCL node.

    *   Add `move_base` node to `amcl.launch`. Remap `scan` topic.
    *   Add parameters for planners and load configuration files (e.g., `costmap_common_params.yaml`) using `rosparam`.
*   **L. Teleop Package**
    *   Allows controlling the robot with keyboard commands.
    *   Clone `teleop_twist_keyboard`, build, and run.
*   **M. Launching and Testing (Localization Project)**
    *   Launch simulation, then AMCL launch file.
    *   **RViz Configuration**: Setup RViz to visualize `RobotModel`, `Map`, and **`PoseArray`** (`/particlecloud` topic).
    *   **Tuning Parameters**: Adjust `transform_tolerance`, `update_frequency`, `publish_frequency` for warnings.
    *   **AMCL Parameters**: Focus on `min_particles`/`max_particles`, `initial_pose`, `update_min*` (overall filter); `likelihood_field` model, `laser_*_range`, `laser_max_beams`, `laser_z_hit`, `laser_z_rand` (laser); `odom_model_type` (`diff-corrected`), `odom_alphas` (odometry). Extensive experimentation required.
*   **N. Testing (Localization Project)**
    *   Control robot via **RViz 2D Nav Goal** or **teleop node** to observe localization performance and tune parameters.

**VI. Mapping: Occupancy Grids and SLAM**
*   **A. Occupancy Grid Mapping Algorithm**
    *   **Goal**: Estimate map `m` given noisy measurements `z` and known poses `x`.
    *   Focus on **2D maps** for mobile robots with laser rangefinders.
    *   **Three Approaches to Map Estimation**:
        *   `P(m | z_1:t, x_1:t)`: Computationally expensive.
        *   `P(m_i | z_1:t, x_1:t)`: Independent cells, still drawbacks.
        *   **`Product_i P(m_i | z_1:t, x_1:t)` (Factorization/Product of Marginals)**: Best approach, relates cells, handles memory.
    *   **Inverse Measurement Model**: `P(x | z_1:t)` (estimating state given measurement), generally used when measurements are complex.
    *   **Log Odds Ratio**: `log(P(A|B) / (1-P(A|B)))` avoids probability instabilities, improves speed/accuracy.
    *   **Binary Bayes Filter**: Computes log odds of posterior belief `l_t` by adding previous belief to inverse measurement model log odds and subtracting prior belief.
    *   **C++ Quiz**: Code `occupancyGridMapping()` (processes measurements/poses, updates log odds) and `inverseSensorModel()` (computes range/angle, evaluates cases).
    *   **Visualization**: Code C++ function to plot map cells (green=unknown, black=occupied, red=free) based on log odds values.
    *   **Sensor Fusion**: Combine measurements from multiple maps.
    *   **3D Map Representations**: Discusses various 3D data collection methods (3D lidar, RGBD camera, stereo camera, single camera).
    *   **Desired Characteristics for Maps**: Probabilistic, distinguishes free/unknown space, memory efficient, compact, efficient updates/queries.
    *   **Types of 3D Map Representations**: 2.5D maps (height maps), Elevation maps, Extended elevation maps, Multi-level surface (MLS) maps, Octomap.
*   **B. SLAM Problem (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**
    *   **Online SLAM**: Estimates current pose and map given current measurements/controls.
    *   **Full SLAM**: Estimates entire robot path and map given all measurements/controls.
    *   **Nature**:
        *   **Continuous**: Robot poses and object locations are continuous.
        *   **Discrete**: **Correspondence** (identifying previously seen objects/locations) is binary.
    *   **Challenges**: High dimensionality of continuous parameters, exponential increase of discrete correspondence values. Infeasible to compute exact posterior; requires approximation. Particle filters (MCL) fail due to high dimensionality.
*   **C. FastSLAM**
    *   Solves Full SLAM with known correspondences.
    *   **Approach**: Particle filter for trajectory, low-dimensional EKF for map features (Rao-Blackwellized particle filter).
    *   Solves both Full and Online SLAM.
    *   **Instances**:
        *   **FastSLAM 1.0/2.0**: Differ in efficiency, both use EKF for map features.
        *   **Grid-based FastSLAM**: Extension to occupancy grid maps for arbitrary environments (no predefined landmarks). Each particle maintains a trajectory guess and its own map (updated via Occupancy Grid Mapping).
        *   Key Techniques: Sampling motion, map estimation, importance weight.
    *   **gmapping ROS package**: Based on Grid-based FastSLAM, provides laser-based SLAM for 2D occupancy grid maps.
*   **D. SLAM with ROS (Lab Implementation)**
    *   **Setup**: Clone `gmapping` package, install dependencies, build.
    *   **Launch Sequence**: Launch `turtlebot_world.launch` (Gazebo), `keyboard_teleop.launch`, `slam_gmapping` node, and `rviz` (configured to display map, robot model).
    *   **Mapping**: Drive robot using keyboard to map the environment.
    *   **Saving Map**: Use `map_server map_saver` to generate `map.pgm` (occupancy grid image) and `map.yaml` (metadata).
    *   **Map Quality**: Default `gmapping` parameters may result in low quality; tuning parameters like `angularUpdate`, `linearUpdate`, map limits, and number of particles is essential.
    *   **Notation**: Poses (triangles), features (stars), motion constraints (solid lines), measurement constraints (dashed lines).
*   **E. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) in GraphSLAM**
    *   **GraphSLAM Core**: Graph optimization, minimizing error in constraints.
    *   **Likelihood**: Estimates parameters that best explain observed outcomes.
    *   **Feature Measurement Example**: Robot takes repeated noisy measurements. Most probable location is represented by product of probabilities.
    *   **Analytical Solution**:
        *   Remove scaling factors from probability distributions.
        *   Convert to **Log-Likelihood** (product of exponentials becomes sum of exponents) for simpler optimization; minimize negative log-likelihood.
        *   **Optimization**: Take first derivative of error function, set to zero to find minimum. For multiple variables, solve system of equations.
    *   **Overview**: Analytical steps for MLE involve reducing equations to a simpler form and finding extrema.
    *   Constraints are labeled with their negative log-likelihood error (e.g., `(zt - (xt + mt))^2 / sigma^2` for measurement).
    *   **GraphSLAM Objective**: Minimize the sum of all constraints (motion and measurement errors).
    *   **MLE Example**: Demonstrates solving a 1D problem with motion and measurement constraints analytically, including considering non-trivial variances.
    *   **Limitation**: Analytical solutions become computationally intensive for complex/multi-dimensional problems.
*   **F. Numerical Solution to MLE**
    *   Alternative for complex problems, found in a fraction of the time.
    *   Uses **optimization algorithms** (e.g., gradient descent, Levenberg-Marquardt) to find local minima quickly.
    *   **Gradient Descent**: Adjust initial guess incrementally opposite the gradient to reach a minimum. Can get stuck in local minima; stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can help.
*   **G. 1-D to n-D (GraphSLAM Data Structures)**
    *   For multi-dimensional systems, constraints use **matrices and covariances** (`z_t - h(x_t, m_j))^T Q_t^-1 (z_t - h(x_t, m_j))` etc.).
    *   The sum of all constraints `JGraphSLAM` includes an initial constraint for the first robot pose.
    *   Uses **Information Matrix (`Omega`) and Information Vector (`Xi`)** to store data more intelligently. Each operation updates few cells; matrix is "sparse".
*   **H. Inference (GraphSLAM)**
    *   Path and map recovered by **`mu = Omega^-1 * Xi`** (solving system of equations).
    *   **Efficiency depends on topology**:
        *   **Linear Graph**: Robot moves once, linear time solution possible.
        *   **Cyclical Graph**: Robot revisits locations, more challenging matrix.
    *   **Variable Elimination**: Iteratively removes variables (features) to simplify matrix, reducing computational intensity.
    *   In practice, numerical methods are preferred over analytical inference.
*   **I. Nonlinear Constraints (GraphSLAM)**
    *   Most motion and measurement constraints are nonlinear and **must be linearized** using **Taylor Series** (approximated with Jacobian matrix) before adding to information matrix/vector.
    *   **Linearizing Constraints**: Requires a pose estimate (`mu`) to linearize around.
    *   **Iterative Optimization**: Linearization process is repeated. Each iteration uses the previous solution as a better estimate for linearization, leading to convergence.
    *   **Workflow**: Collect data -> (Until convergence: Linearize constraints, solve system of equations).
*   **J. Loop Closure (RTAB-Map)**
    *   **Importance**: Corrects accumulated errors, creates smoother and accurate maps. Without it, maps look choppy and repeated.
    *   **Memory Management**: RTAB-Map uses Short Term Memory (STM), Working Memory (WM), and Long-Term Memory (LTM) to limit candidates for real-time loop closure detection.
*   **K. RTAB-Map Optimization and Output**
    *   **Graph Optimization**: When loop closure accepted, a graph optimizer (TORO, G2O, GTSAM) minimizes errors, correcting the map by propagating errors from odometry.
    *   **Map Output**: Generates 2D/3D occupancy grid maps or 3D point clouds.
*   **L. Complexity (Graph SLAM vs RTAB-Map)**
    *   **Graph-SLAM Complexity**: Linear with number of nodes.
    *   **RTAB-Map Complexity**: Constant time due to memory management limiting nodes for loop closure.
*   **M. Project Overview: Map My World! (RTAB-Map Project)**
    *   **Goal**: Create 2D occupancy grid and 3D octomap from simulated environment using RTAB-Map with your robot.
    *   **`rtabmap_ros`**: ROS wrapper for RTAB-Map.
    *   **Project Flow**: Develop package to interface with `rtabmap_ros`, adapt localization project (e.g., add RGB-D camera), configure files/links/topics/launch files, teleop robot to map.
*   **N. Simulation Setup (Project 4)**
    *   Setup `catkin_ws` in Project 4 Workspace, transfer code from previous project (git or folder upload). Verify setup.
*   **O. RTAB-Map Package Requirements and Sensor Upgrade**
    *   **Robot Configuration**: Requires 2D Laser, Odometry, and **3D Camera** (e.g., Kinect).
    *   **Sensor Upgrade**: Add `camera_optical_joint` and `camera_link_optical` to `.xacro` for proper camera alignment. Replace `libgazebo_ros_camera.so` with `libgazebo_ros_openni_kinect.so` in `.gazebo` file and configure RGB-D camera parameters and topics (e.g., `rgb/image_raw`, `depth/image_raw`).
*   **P. Launch File (`mapping.launch`)**
    *   Create `mapping.launch` in your package's `launch` folder.
    *   **Purpose**: Main node for RTAB-Map SLAM.
    *   Defines arguments for topics (e.g., `rgb_topic`, `depth_topic`, `camera_info_topic`).
    *   Configures `rtabmap` node parameters for detection rate, 2D SLAM, loop closure (detector strategy, max features, min inliers), and memory management. Remaps input and output topics.
*   **Q. Real-Time Visualization (`rtabmapviz`)**
    *   An additional node for real-time visualization of feature mapping and loop closures (not recommended for simulation due to computing overhead). Code snippet available to add to `mapping.launch`.
*   **R. ROS Teleop Package (for RTAB-Map)**
    *   Needed to navigate robot during mapping. Clone `teleop_twist_keyboard` and compile.
*   **S. Map My World! (Launching and Best Practices)**
    *   Launch sequence: `world.launch` (Gazebo/RViz), `teleop_twist_keyboard.py`, `mapping.launch`.
    *   **Best Practices**: Start with low velocity, aim for 3 loop closures, maximize feature detection by revisiting paths. Copy database file after mapping as it's deleted on `mapping` node startup.
*   **T. Database Analysis (`rtabmap-databaseViewer`)**
    *   Tool for analyzing mapping session database, separate from ROS.
    *   Usage: `rtabmap-databaseViewer ~/.ros/rtabmap.db`.
    *   View constraints, graph, images, feature detection, loop closures.
    *   Understand loop closure codes (Neighbor, Global Loop closure, etc.).
*   **U. Optional: RTAB-Map Localization**
    *   Modify `mapping.launch` to `localization.launch` for localization purposes. Remove `delete_db_on_start`, remove `Mem/NotLinkedNodesKept`, add `Mem/IncrementalMemory: false`.

**VII. Path Planning: Algorithms and Concepts**
*   **A. Introduction to Path Planning**
    *   **Path planning**: Strategic ("How do I get there?"). **Obstacle avoidance**: Tactical.
    *   **Applications**: Vacuum robots, self-driving cars, assistive robotics, exploratory rovers, computer graphics, computational biology.
    *   **Terminology**:
        *   **Complete**: Algorithm finds path if one exists.
        *   **Optimal**: Finds the best solution.
    *   **Bug Algorithm**: Simple method; not complete (can get stuck) or optimal.
*   **B. Approaches to Path Planning**
    *   **Discrete (Combinatorial) Path Planning**: Discretizes workspace into a graph, applies graph-search. Precise, thorough, but computationally expensive for high dimensions.
    *   **Sample-Based Path Planning**: Probes workspace randomly to construct a graph. Quicker, less precise, finds feasible (not necessarily optimal) paths.
    *   **Probabilistic Path Planning**: Accounts for robot motion uncertainty, useful in constrained environments.
*   **C. Configuration Space (C-space)**
    *   Set of all robot poses. Obstacles are "inflated" by robot's radius, treating robot as a point.
    *   Consists of `C_Free` (free space) and `C_Obs` (occupied space).
*   **D. Minkowski Sum**
    *   Mathematical property used to compute the C-space by "growing" obstacles by the shape of the robot.
    *   Trivial for convex polygons, more expensive for non-convex.
    *   C++ quiz to code Minkowski Sum.
    *   Requires translation to shift the configuration space correctly.
*   **E. 3D Configuration Space**
    *   Dimension of C-space equals number of robot's degrees of freedom.
    *   For a robot that can translate in 2D and rotate, a third dimension is added for rotation. Can be visualized as stacked 2D layers.
*   **F. Roadmap Methods (Discretization)**
    *   Represent C-space as a connected graph.
    *   **Phases**:
        *   **Construction**: Builds graph from continuous space (time-consuming but reusable).
        *   **Query**: Finds path on the graph using search algorithm.
    *   **Visibility Graph**: Connects start, goal, and obstacle vertices. Complete and contains the optimal (shortest) path, but provides **no clearance** from obstacles.
    *   **Voronoi Diagram**: Maximizes clearance between obstacles by building edges equidistant from them. Complete, but does not guarantee an optimal path.
*   **G. Cell Decomposition (Discretization)**
    *   Divides space into discrete cells (nodes).
    *   **Exact Cell Decomposition**: Divides space into non-overlapping, irregular shapes (triangles, trapezoids). Precise, complete. Computationally complex for irregular shapes/high dimensions.
    *   **Approximate Cell Decomposition**: Divides space into simple, regular shapes (rectangles, squares). More practical.
        *   **Simple Decomposition**: Grid of equal-sized cells; loses completeness if path blocked by partially occupied cells.
        *   **Iterative Decomposition**: Recursively divides cells into quadrants (e.g., **quadtree** for 2D, **octrees** for 3D). Approaches completeness with computation, but not optimal (finds obvious solutions first).
*   **H. Potential Field Method (Discretization)**
    *   Generates an **attractive field** (pulls to goal) and a **repulsive field** (pushes from obstacles). Sums them to guide robot via gradient descent.
    *   **Attractive Potential Field**: Quadratic function with global minimum at goal.
    *   **Repulsive Potential Field**: Zero in free space, large near obstacles.
    *   **Problems**: **Not complete or optimal**. Can get stuck in local minima.
*   **I. Uninformed vs Informed Search**
    *   **Uninformed**: No goal information, blind search (e.g., Breadth-first Search, Depth-first Search, Uniform Cost Search).
    *   **Informed**: Provided with goal information, evaluates promising nodes (e.g., **A* Search**).
*   **J. Terminology (Search Algorithms)**
    *   **Time Complexity**: How long an algorithm takes.
    *   **Space Complexity**: Memory required.
    *   **Generality**: Type of problems an algorithm can solve.
    *   **LIFO (Last In First Out)**, **FIFO (First In First Out)**.
*   **K. A* Search (Details)**
    *   Orders frontier by `f(n) = g + h` (path cost + heuristic).
    *   **Optimal if heuristic is consistent (obeys triangle inequality) and admissible (never overestimates true cost)**.
    *   Common heuristics: Euclidean or Manhattan distance.
    *   Variants exist for dynamic/large environments.
*   **L. Overall Concerns Regarding Search**
    *   **Bidirectional Search**: Conducts two searches simultaneously to improve efficiency.
    *   **Path Proximity to Obstacles**: Optimal path may be too close to obstacles; can be addressed by "smoothing" maps (higher cost near obstacles).
    *   **Paths Aligned to Grid**: Paths may appear zig-zag; path smoothing can fix this.
*   **M. Path Planning Lab (BFS and A* Implementation)**
    *   **Goal**: Code Breadth-first Search (BFS) and A* algorithm in C++ to find shortest path on a grid. Compare efficiency. Apply A* to a real-world map.
    *   **Modeling the Problem**: Define `Map` and `Planner` classes, represent cells as triplets `[g, x, y]`.
    *   **BFS: Expansion List**: `search` function expands cells with lowest cost.
    *   **BFS: Expansion Vector**: Stores order of cell expansion.
    *   **BFS: Shortest Path**: Records robot actions in a `policy` 2D vector.
    *   **A*: Shortest Path**: Modify BFS to use A* (Manhattan-based heuristic), expands cells with lowest `f = g + h` value, cell represented as quadruplet `[f, g, x, y]`.
    *   **Comparison (BFS vs A*)**: A* is more efficient (fewer expansions).
    *   **A*: Real-World Map**: Apply A* to map data (log odds converted to 0s/1s), implement `MapToGrid` and `GeneratedHeuristic` functions.
    *   **A*: Visualization**: Modify visualization function to plot start, goal, and shortest path on the map.
*   **N. Why Sample-Based Planning?**
    *   Discrete planning is too inefficient for high-dimensional problems due to exponential complexity (e.g., `3^n - 1` successors in n-dimensions).
    *   Challenges with **constrained dynamics** (e.g., non-holonomic systems like cars).
    *   **Weakening Requirements**: Seek **probabilistically complete** (finds path with probability approaching 1 over time) and **feasible** (obeys constraints) paths instead of complete and optimal. Sample-based planning achieves this.
    *   Downfalls: Uniform sampling may miss narrow passages.
*   **O. Sample-Based Path Planning (Methods)**
    *   **Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM)**: Builds a graph by generating random collision-free configurations and connecting k-nearest neighbors. Multi-query planner (reusable graph).
    *   **Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Method (RRT)**: Initializes two trees (start/goal), iteratively generates random configurations and extends trees towards them. Single-query planner (not reusable graph), but quicker than PRM for single queries. Supports non-holonomic systems.
    *   **Path Smoothing (Shortcutter)**: Optimizes paths by replacing longer segments with shorter, collision-free edges.
*   **P. Overall Concerns (Sample-Based)**
    *   **Not Complete**: Only probabilistically complete.
    *   **Not Optimal**: True optimal path may not be represented in the sampled graph.
    *   No "silver bullet" algorithm; solutions often customized.
*   **Q. Markov Decision Process (MDP)**
    *   Framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Defined by states, actions, non-deterministic transition model, and rewards.
    *   **Markov Assumption**: Transition depends only on present state.
    *   **In Path Planning**: Robot is fully aware of transition model and rewards.
    *   Robot actions are non-deterministic (e.g., wheel slip); defines an environment with rewards for different terrains/hazards.
    *   Probabilistic path planning aims for efficient and **safe** paths considering uncertainty.
*   **R. Policies (MDP)**
    *   **Solution to an MDP**: A policy (π) is a mapping from states to actions.
    *   **Optimal Policy (π*)**: Informs best action to maximize overall reward.
    *   **Expected Rewards**: Calculated considering the non-deterministic transition model.
*   **S. State Utility (MDP)**
    *   **Definition**: Represents how attractive a state is with respect to the goal (expected return from that state following the policy).
    *   **Calculation**: Iterative process summing rewards from current state to goal.
    *   **Determining Optimal Policy**: Choose action that maximizes state utility (often by working backward from goal).
    *   **Discounting (`gamma`)**: Often applied to future rewards to account for uncertainty (`gamma` < 1).
*   **T. Value Iteration Algorithm (MDP)**
    *   Algorithm to find the optimal policy for MDPs.
    *   Iteratively calculates more accurate state utilities until convergence, using `U(s) = R(s) + gamma * max_a Sum_s' T(s,a,s') U(s')`.

**VIII. Home Service Robot Project**

    *   Create `test_navigation.sh` to launch `turtlebot_world.launch`, `amcl` (localization), `move_base` (navigation), and `rviz`.
*   **E. Reaching Multiple Goals (Autonomous)**
    *   **Goal**: Write a C++ node (`pick_objects`) to autonomously send successive goals to the ROS navigation stack.
    *   Modify existing code to change node name, frame_id, and include two goal positions (pickup and drop off zones). Robot should travel to pickup, wait, then travel to drop off, displaying messages.
*   **F. Modeling Virtual Objects (`add_markers` node)**
    *   **Goal**: Model a virtual object with markers in RViz.
    *   Based on ROS marker tutorial.
    *   **Algorithm**: Publish marker at pickup, pause, hide marker, pause, publish marker at drop off zone.
*   **G. Your Home Service Robot (Putting it all Together)**
    *   **Goal**: Simulate a full home service robot by coordinating `add_markers` and `pick_objects` nodes.
    *   **Modify `add_markers`**: Show marker at pickup, hide when robot reaches pickup, wait 5s (pickup), show marker at drop off when robot reaches it.
    *   **Communication**: `add_markers` can subscribe to robot odometry/AMCL pose, use ROS parameters, or a custom variable.

**IX. Career in Robotics**

    *   Interdisciplinary field with diverse career opportunities and growth.
*   **B. Do I need an engineering background?**
    *   Engineering background (CS, Mech, Elec) is helpful, but **not necessary** due to interdisciplinary nature (e.g., psychologists, linguists on teams).
