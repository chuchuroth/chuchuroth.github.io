**Robot Programming and Control**

Robot programming is essential for determining a robot's adaptability. It facilitates the transition of robots from controlled industrial environments to unpredictable service applications, such as residences, hospitals, and workplaces, where they perform tasks from delivery to entertainment. Programming enables unskilled human operators to manage robots more easily. Robot applications can range from simple, utilizing preprogrammed responses, to complex, involving analysis of past events and prediction. Peripheral movements, such as opening/closing grippers, making logical decisions, and communicating with other equipment, are also programmed.

All robot programs typically operate in three modes:
*   **Monitor Mode**: Users specify and teach positions using a teach pendant, which are then saved in memory and used in the software.
*   **Editor Mode**: Allows users to create new applications or modify existing ones, including syntax checking.
*   **Run Mode**: The robot executes the program and performs the defined motion sequences.

Fundamental instructions in robot programming languages include functions for movement and sensing (e.g., `move`, `monitor`), computation (e.g., `add`, `sort`), and flow control (e.g., `return`, `branch`).

**Robot Programming Techniques**

Several methods are employed for programming robots:
*   **Online Programming**: This technique is performed at the production location within the work cell. It involves using a teach pendant to teach position records and functional data, which are then saved in the pendant's memory and transferred to the robot's controller. While convenient for simple tasks and on-the-spot adjustments, a disadvantage is that the manufacturing line must be stopped during programming, leading to production suspension costs and potential safety concerns as the programmer operates within the robot's work envelope. The robot also moves slowly during this process, making it time-consuming and inefficient for flexible manufacturing systems.
*   **Lead Through Programming**:
    *   **Powered Lead Through**: Used with point-to-point control robots, this method employs a teaching pendant or handheld control box with switches to manipulate the robot's joints sequentially. The programmer moves the robot's arm to desired locations, which are then stored in memory. The robot later replays this sequence.
    *   **Manual Lead Through**: This method is used for continuous path manipulation, such as in spray painting. The user physically guides the robot's end-of-arm or attached tools through the action sequence, recording the path in memory. Due to the mass of the robot arm, a lightweight, specially designed training machine with a similar joint arrangement often replaces the actual robot during teaching.
    *   Advantages include ease of programming and minimal requirement for deep programming experience. Disadvantages involve production interruption, limitations on decision-making logic, and lack of interface with other factory computer subsystems.
*   **Walk Through Programming**: An instructor physically contacts the robotic arm and guides it through desired positions within its working envelope. Triggers on manual handles record the robot's position, and the controller later generates motion between these points. This method requires the instructor to be within the robot's work envelope, potentially necessitating deactivation of safety devices, thus posing a hazardous position for the operator. It is effective for spray painting and welding robots.
*   **Offline Programming**: This technique is executed on computer systems situated away from the robot station. Simulation software is used to generate information, which is then sent to the robot's controller and translated into instructions. A primary advantage is that programming can occur concurrently with production, eliminating robot downtime for new task teaching and ensuring high utilization. It also allows for effective programming logic and calculations using advanced debugging tools, program verification through simulation, and utilization of existing CAD data. However, it requires investment in an offline programming mode and substantial training.
*   **Task Level Programming**: This method focuses on specifying object position objectives rather than the robot's specific movements. It aims to be entirely robot-independent, meaning no user-specified locations or robot-geometry-dependent inputs are required. Implementing task-level programming necessitates precise modeling of both the environment and the robot.
*   **Motion Programming**: This style combines verbal statements and lead-through approaches, also referred to as online or offline programming. Textual statements describe the motion, while lead-through tactics define the robot's functionality and alignment throughout the motion. Robot speed is controlled by a dial or input on the teach pendant or main control panel, allowing for testing at safe, slow speeds before production. Motion control can also utilize coordinate systems such as the world coordinate system (relative to robot base) and the tool coordinate system (relative to wrist faceplate), which aid in directing the robot's wrist along straight paths.

**Teach Pendant**

A teach pendant is a device used with a robot or motion device to program robot movements in application programs. It also supports customized functions and serves as the primary management interface for initiating and observing operations.
There are two main types:
*   **Programmer's Pendant**: Designed for software creation and debugging.
*   **Operator's Pendant**: Used during routine device operation, equipped with a palm-operated or panic switch connected to an emergency circuit that cuts arm power when activated.

Teach pendants feature:
*   A **Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)**.
*   **Data Entry Keys**: For information input in response to prompts, including Yes/No, Del, numerical controls, decimal point, and Record Done (functioning as an Enter key).
*   An **Emergency Stop Switch**: Rapidly halts application execution and powers down the robot arm.
*   A **User LED**: Indicates ideal mode when off; illuminates when utility software is using the pendant.
*   **Mode Control Keys**: Change the system used for robot navigation, switch control between teaching apparatus and application programs, and enable arm power.
*   **Manual Control Buttons**: Determine which robotic joint or coordinate axis moves when in manual mode; manual state LEDs indicate the selected mode.
*   **Speed Bars**: Control robot speed and direction, with pushing towards the middle resulting in slower movement and towards the ends for faster movement. A slow button toggles between distinct speed ranges.
*   **Predefined Function Buttons**: Assigned system-wide functions such as displaying coordinates or clearing errors.
*   **Programmable Function Buttons**: Utilized in bespoke application programs, with functions varying based on the running application.
*   **Soft Buttons**: Their functionalities differ depending on the running application program or the choice made from predefined function buttons.

**Robot Programming Languages**

Almost all robots are controlled using specific programming languages, which direct their movements and interpret inputs, thereby enabling adaptability and environmental interaction through sensors. Many of these languages are extensions of major computer programming languages, leveraging their robust logical testing capabilities. Examples include Karel and Robot Script. The diversity of languages across robot vendors creates a need for a universal robot language capable of handling complex movements and interacting with numerous sensors and equipment.

Historically, early robot teaching methods did not use word-based languages, relying on mechanical configuration, point-to-point paths, route tracking, and work lead-through.

Examples of high-level robot programming languages include:
*   **Wave**: The first high-level language designed for robots, created in 1973 at Stanford Artificial Laboratory.
*   **AL (Arm Language)**: A high-level language developed at Stanford Robotics Research Lab.
*   **ARCL (Advanced Robotics Command Language)**: A conversational command language used by Yaskawa robots with a Pascal-like syntax.
*   **AML (A Manufacturing Language)**: Used for IBM-manufactured robots, providing a fully-interpreted language with high-level programming support.
*   **APT (Automatically Programmed Tool)**: Developed by MIT's ESL in 1956, focusing on motion.
*   **Karel 1, 2, and 3**: Used by FANUC robot controllers.
*   **CAP 1 (Conversational Auto Programming 1)**: Controlled by the FANUC 32-18-T robot controller.
*   **MML (Man Machine Language)**: A model-based mobile robot language from UC Berkeley, featuring offline programming, sensor functionality, model description, and path planning.
*   **MCL (Manufacturing Control Language)**: Created by McDonnell Douglas for the US Air Force ICAM project.
*   **RAIL**: A high-level programming language developed by Automatics for robotics and vision systems.
*   **ARMBASIC**: An extension of the BASIC language, used with the Microbot MiniMover 5 instructional robot.
*   **Androtext**: A high-level language developed by Robotronic Corporation for personal robot control.
*   **Ladder Logic**: Designed for electricians, resembling relay logic, used for robots without a microcontroller or programmable logic controller.
*   **VAL (Victor's Assembly Language)**: Developed for the PUMA robot family, similar to BASIC, with a comprehensive vocabulary for program development and review. A VAL program for a simple pick-and-place operation from location A to location B would involve commands like `appro` (approach), `move`, `close`, `depart`, and `open`.

**Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) and Safety**

Collaboration between humans and robots is gaining importance in modern manufacturing processes. However, the shared workspace can lead to safety concerns. To mitigate these risks, systems combine sensors, laser scanning, machine vision, alarms, and panic buttons to reduce robot arm speed, halt movement, or modify trajectories.

Robot programmers utilize a **digital twin environment**, or virtual environment, to enhance human safety during robot programming. A human-robot collaboration system comprises three main components:
*   **Physically Existent Robotic Cell (Real Environment)**: Includes the robot, robot controller, and human operator.
*   **Virtual Robotic Cell**: Consists of a virtual robot, a human model representing the coworker, virtual jigs, fixtures, or machinery mimicking the physical cell, and a computational element.
*   **Interface**: Connects the real and virtual environments. This typically involves a tracking sensor (e.g., Kinect) to identify the human's pose in the physical cell, and a microcontroller that processes this data and transmits transformed outputs to the robot controller.

In the virtual environment, software like Unity 3D processes sensor data and creates a digital twin of the workspace. The robot's work envelope is divided into zones (e.g., parallelepipeds), and "region colliders" monitor collisions of the human avatar within these zones. When a specific human model is detected, a special character is sent via a serial port to the microcontroller. The microcontroller, often an Arduino Mega programmed in C or C++, receives these signals and sets associated output pins to a high state, informing the robot controller.

Based on information from the microcontroller indicating a person crossing the robot's path, the robot implements specific **avoiding policies**:
*   **Human Avoidance**: The robot modifies its trajectory to bypass the human and will not proceed into a region occupied by a person. If the human moves during avoidance, the robot may retract to a starting point and resume its normal path or initiate a new avoidance course. Avoidance paths are defined by precision points.
*   **Robot Stoppage**: The robot immediately halts its movement if a human crosses its current path. It will resume its path only when the user exits the monitored region.
*   **Robot Slowdown**: The robot reduces its pace when a human is detected within predetermined shop floor zones. If the distance falls below a specific threshold, the robot will stop. Speed reduction can be linked to distance or relative velocity.

These policies typically involve the human and robot cohabiting the same workspace while performing individual tasks, rather than direct cooperation. If cooperation is required, the robotic system will stop or reduce speed, allowing the human worker to intentionally interact. The Staubli RX90L, a six-axis robot with specific load capacity, reach, and accuracy, is an example used in such case studies, programmed with the V+ language. V+ commands like `REACTI` and `SIGNAL` are crucial for implementing these safety policies by enabling the robot to react to human presence.

**Robotic Vision**

Robotic vision is a sophisticated technology that enables robots to recognize, navigate, locate, inspect, and handle objects before performing applications. It enhances efficiency and product quality by increasing the adaptability of industrial robots within integrated production processes. Unlike computer vision, which outputs images or information, robotic vision produces a physical action.

A machine vision system involves multiple sub-parts:
*   **Image Formation**: Critical for successful system deployment.
*   **Image Acquisition and Pre-processing**: Converts analog video signals to digital and enhances images.
*   **Image Analysis**: Processes the enhanced digital image.
*   **Image Interpretation**: Provides digital information to the manufacturing cell.

The system architecture typically includes a vision sensor (camera), digitizing equipment, a computer terminal, and hardware/software for interfacing. Key tasks in machine vision include data collection from image sensing and digitizing, image processing and analysis, and vision system applications.

**Components for Data Collection in Robotic Vision**
*   **Camera**: Used to view images after sensing and digitizing visual data.
    *   **1D Vision**: Analyzes digital signals line by line, often used for flaw detection in continuous materials.
    *   **2D Vision**: Most inspection cameras perform area scans, capturing 2D images. Line scan cameras create 2D images line by line.
    *   **3D Vision**: Often uses multiple cameras or laser displacement sensors to triangulate on an objective position in 3D space, providing part orientation data for robotic guidance.
    *   **Color Representation**:
        *   **Binary Image**: Uses two pixel intensity values (0 for black, 1 for white), commonly for image segmentation.
        *   **Grayscale Image**: Pixels are represented by data bits (2-8 or more), allowing for 2^n shades of gray, where 'n' is the number of bits. Quantization digitally transforms video signals.
        *   **Color Image (RGB)**: Modern systems use RGB (Red, Green, Blue) channels. A 24-bit image, for example, allocates 8 bits per channel, allowing for 16.7 million (2^24) possible color combinations.
    *   **Spatial Resolution**: Defines the number of elements in an image (rows and columns of a matrix), specifying its length and width. Common resolutions include 640x480 for RS-170/NTSC and 768x576 for CCIR/PAL. Higher resolutions (1024x1024 and above) are used for high-accuracy gauging and measurement.
*   **Frame Grabber**: An electrical device that receives the visual stream, digitizes the signal, and stores it as a 2D array of integer values (pixels) in a frame buffer. It can digitize images at 25-30 frames per second, with sampling determining pixel density.
*   **Reference Frames**:
    *   **Object Coordinate Frame**: Coordinates remain unchanged regardless of object placement.
    *   **World Coordinate Frame**: Relates objects in 3D space.
    *   **Pixel Coordinate Frame**: Represents pixel position as row X column integers.
    *   **Camera Coordinate Frame**: Represents objects relative to the camera's location.
    *   **Image Plane Coordinate Frame (CCD Plane)**: Refers to a point in a plane where both coordinates are taken.
*   **Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)**: The process of converting analog signals into digital data, involving three phases:
    *   **Sampling**: Discretizing the continuous signal into a stream of analog signals at regular intervals.
    *   **Quantization**: Assigning each discrete analog signal to one of a predefined set of amplitude levels.
    *   **Encoding**: Converting the quantized amplitude levels into a digital code, represented as a string of binary numbers.
    *   Factors for ADC selection include sampling rate, conversion time, and resolution.
*   **Lighting**: A critical component where the light source and its positioning relative to the object and camera form a lighting strategy. Proper lighting can enhance images by silhouetting components or accentuating specific features to enable accurate measurements of edges.
*   **Camera Technologies**:
    *   **Vidicon Tube**: Uses a photoconductor to form a charge density pattern, which is scanned by an electron beam to reproduce the captured scene. Can be sensitive to the infrared spectrum.
    *   **Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs)**: Operate on the photoelectric effect, storing accumulated charges (minority carriers) in potential wells under MOS capacitors. These charges are then sequentially collected from pixels, transferred, and converted into an analog output voltage or digital data.
    *   **Charge Injection Devices (CIDs)**: Similar to CCDs but inject charge into the substrate by removing the potential well, causing a photocurrent to flow through a shift register to develop an output voltage. CIDs have high unit costs but offer stable geometric configurations and good dynamic range.

**Image Processing and Analysis Techniques**

**Image Processing** involves transforming an image to improve visibility, derive quantitative information, or adjust photometric/geometric terms. It includes techniques such as:
*   **Data Reduction**: Reduces the amount of image data through methods like digital conversion (reducing gray levels) and windowing (focusing processing on a desired image part).
*   **Image Filters**: Remove random noise while preserving critical details. These can be fuzzy-based or traditional (spatial domain, directly on pixels; or transform domain, analyzing signals in another domain).
*   **Noise Reduction Techniques**:
    *   **Convolution Mask**: A spatial domain operation applied pixel by pixel to modify the image, useful for filtering and edge identification.
    *   **Image Averaging**: Averages multiple shots of the same scene to reduce random noise without blurring, but requires cessation of scene activity and is ineffective against systematic noise.
    *   **Frequency Domain Filtering**: Selectively removes noise frequencies identified by Fourier transform.
    *   **Median Filters**: Replaces a pixel's value with the median of its neighbors, effective for salt and pepper noise and speckle noise, and preserves edges.
*   **Segmentation**: Divides an image into distinct entities with similar characteristics, representing different parts of the image. Techniques include thresholding, region growing, and edge detection.
    *   **Thresholding**: Segments an image into multiple levels or parts by comparing pixel values to a threshold, resulting in binary images (black or white).
    *   **Region Growing**: A sequential process where pixels satisfying certain criteria are grouped into a region by evaluating and adding analogous neighboring pixels.
    *   **Edge Detection**: Processes that identify boundaries or edges in an image, crucial for segmentation and object recognition. Algorithms like Sobel, Roberts, and Prewitt operators, and techniques like the Hough transformation, are used to detect significant pixel intensity shifts.
*   **Morphological Operations**: Simple transformations applied to binary or grayscale images to eliminate defects and maintain image structure. They can increase/decrease object size and close/open gaps.
    *   **Binary Morphological Operations**: Include thickening (smoothing boundaries), dilation (enlarging objects), erosion (shrinking objects), skeletonization (reducing objects to a single-pixel "skeleton"), and fill operations (filling holes).
    *   **Gray Morphology Operations**: Work on grayscale images using MIN (erosion) or MAX (dilation) operators to alter pixel values based on neighborhood darkest/lightest pixels.

**Image Analysis** involves extracting meaningful information from an image by processing it into fundamental components, such as finding shapes, detecting edges, removing noise, and counting objects.
*   **Object Identification Features**: Include average/maximum/minimum gray levels, object circumference, area, diameter, number of holes, aspect ratio (width to length), thinness, and moments.
*   **Moments**: Statistical parameters that capture global and detailed geometric information about an image, measuring the distribution of pixel locations and intensities. They are applicable in invariant pattern recognition, image encoding, and pose estimation.
*   **Depth Information Collection**: Methods like range finders and stereo vision systems (which analyze point pairings in two images) are used to collect 3D depth data from a scene. Active triangulation, often with laser range finders, is a highly accurate method for determining depth.
*   **Object Identification Methods**:
    *   **Template Matching**: A digital image processing technique that finds small image portions matching a pre-selected template. It is simpler than neural networks, requiring no data annotation, offering better precision with bounding boxes, and not requiring a GPU. It works by calculating a similarity measure between the recorded image portion and the template.
    *   **Structural Techniques (Syntactic Pattern Recognition)**: Represent objects as strings, trees, or graphs, defining descriptions and recognition rules based on structural relationships. This method focuses on how an object's characteristics or edges relate to one another. It involves pattern primitives (simplest sub-patterns), pattern description languages, and grammar to define complex patterns hierarchically. Syntactic analysis (parsing) interprets the image according to a structural model.

**Object Detection**

Object detection is a computer vision technology that locates and identifies objects within an image or video, typically by creating bounding boxes around them to determine their location and movement. It differs from image labeling, which only identifies elements present without specifying individual instances or locations.

Object detection techniques can be categorized as:
*   **Machine Learning (ML)-based**: Identifies pixel groupings (e.g., color histogram, edges) using computer vision algorithms, then uses these features as input for a regression model to predict object location and label.
*   **Deep Learning (DL)-based**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for end-to-end unsupervised object detection, eliminating the need for separate feature definition and extraction.

Object detection enables applications such as crowd counting, self-driving cars, video surveillance, face detection, and anomaly detection. Models generally consist of an **encoder** (processes input image to extract statistical features) and a **decoder** (receives encoder outputs and determines bounding boxes and labels). Decoders can be pure regressors or **Region Proposal Networks (RPNs)**, which simultaneously predict object bounds and scores, generating high-quality region proposals.

Challenges in object detection include handling flexible, deformed, or non-rigid objects, as well as variations in material, color, and flexibility. A **two-stage cost-effective vision detection system** is often preferred to address these complexities.
A typical sequence of operations for object detection involves steps from image capture to world coordinate generation, including:
1.  Converting color images to binary images.
2.  Recognizing items as discrete regions.
3.  Loading intrinsic camera parameters.
4.  Comparing the number of chosen pixels to a limit to prevent false edge detection.
5.  Determining threshold values in user-defined areas.
6.  Handling overlaps where flexible object points might be mistaken for edges.
7.  Producing concentric circles to find optimal gripping points for objects like tubular items.
8.  Calibrating the camera to convert pixel coordinates to world coordinates.
9.  Ensuring complete object orientation using the robot's gripping stance and fixed axes, converting 2D angles to quaternion form (Roll, Pitch, Yaw).

A cross-section recognition algorithm involves scaling image gray values, dividing the image into regions based on gray values and depth, identifying the highest gray value region (cross-section), calculating region characteristics, dividing regions into sub-areas, comparing widths, and using intermediate area orientation to distinguish edges, ultimately outputting the gripped edge type and its orientation.

**Applications of Robotic Vision in Industries**

Robotic vision plays a crucial role in the ongoing technological revolution, particularly within **Industry 4.0**, alongside technologies like the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Cloud Computing. For robots in a smart factory, robotic vision is integral to their look, behavior, interactional skills, and safety.

Machine vision systems, utilizing both open-source and commercial software, employ various image processing techniques for industrial applications, including:
*   **Inspection**: Counting light/dark pixels, binarization (grayscale to black/white), segmentation (locating/counting objects, recognizing rotated/hidden/resized objects), barcode reading, measurement (object size, text identification), automated text reading (OCR, OCV), template comparison (finding/counting patterns), and surface defect inspection.
*   **Safety Measures**: Essential in cooperative work situations to ensure human operator safety. HRC systems use cameras with human skeleton detectors to monitor distance in real-time, limiting robot speed or generating repulsion vectors if humans approach or violate safety thresholds.
*   **Navigation and Interaction**: Enables robotic systems to traverse and interact with their surroundings by detecting and recognizing objects and comprehending 3D structures. This supports stationary and mobile robots in recognizing, handling, and assembling diverse components.
*   **Collaborative Applications**: Types include coexistence, sequential cooperation, parallel cooperation, and full collaboration.
*   **Calibration**: Both robot and camera calibration use coordinate sets, with camera calibration adapting depth cameras for accuracy.
*   **Manufacturing Case Studies**:
    *   **Automobile Manufacturing**: Mobile Robotic Platforms (MRPs) with vision sensors can move freely, handle heavy pieces, and perform screwing tasks collaboratively with human operators, dynamically assigned to various stations to improve ergonomics and flexibility.
    *   **Quality Control**: Machine vision systems are used for online fault inspection of float glass (detecting defects, resolving false positives) and verifying vehicle instrument clusters (using vision tools for feature recognition, measurement, and text reading).
    *   **Robotic Welding Systems**: Include teach boxes, gas supply, power sources, controllers, industrial manipulators, and positioners. Lasers are often used as structured light sources for vision systems, which capture images of the weld region for monitoring and control through integrated modules. Offline programming frameworks can develop robot programs from 3D CAD models for welding applications.

Additional industrial applications of machine vision include positioning, biometrics, visual inventory control, counting, and quality checks in electronic manufacturing and food production.
