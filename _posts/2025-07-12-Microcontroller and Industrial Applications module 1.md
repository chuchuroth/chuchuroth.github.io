### 8051 Microcontroller Architecture

The 8051 is an **8-bit microcontroller** belonging to the **MCS 51 family**. It is a **40-pin IC**. Its family members (e.g., 80C51BH, 8051AH) may have minor differences in pin count, ROM presence, and timer numbers.

**Major Functional Blocks of 8051:**
The 8051 architecture comprises several integrated components built as a single integrated chip:
*   **Microprocessor Unit (CPU)**: The core for computing, controlling, and triggering operations. It handles arithmetic logical operations, storage control, I/O control, speed matching, interrupt attention, and stack memory operations via **buses**.
*   **Memory**: Includes both on-chip and support for external memory.
*   **Input/Output (I/O) Ports**: For communication with external devices.
*   **Timers/Counters**: For timing and counting events.
*   **Interrupts**: For reacting to events efficiently.
*   **Oscillator**: Generates clock pulses for internal operations.

**CPU Subcomponents (as described for 8051):**
*   **Accumulator (A)**: An 8-bit major register. It holds one of the data for the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) during computations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and is used for external memory operations.
*   **B-Register**: An 8-bit general-purpose register. It functions as a scratchpad register, but is specifically used to hold data during multiplication and division.
*   **Temporary Registers (Temp1, Temp2)**: Used to hold input data for the ALU.
*   **Program Status Word (PSW)**: A bitwise function register (SFR address D0H) that stores the status of arithmetic operation results via various **flags**:
    *   **CY (Carry Flag)**: Indicates a 9th-bit overflow for an 8-bit operation.
    *   **AC (Auxiliary Carry Flag)**: Indicates overflow from D3 to D4.
    *   **OV (Overflow Flag)**: Used for signed two's complement operations.
    *   **P (Parity Flag)**: Reflects the parity (usually odd parity).
    *   **F0 (User Defined Flag)**: Used for program event status by users.
    *   **RS1, RS0**: Bits that select one of four **register banks** (00 for Bank 0, 01 for Bank 1, 10 for Bank 2, 11 for Bank 3). Register Bank 0 (00H-07H) is the default code space upon power-up.
*   **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Contains adders, comparators, multipliers for arithmetic operations, and combinational circuits for logical operations. Its computation results directly impact the PSW register.
*   **Instruction Register**: Receives the instruction opcode.
*   **Timing and Control Block**: Generates control signals like Program Store Enable (PSEN), Address Latch Enable (ALE), External Access (EA), and Reset (RST) using the oscillator input.
*   **Program Counter (PC)**: Holds the address of the next instruction.
*   **PC Incrementor and Buffer**.
*   **Stack Pointer (SP)**.
*   **Data Pointer (DPTR)**: A 16-bit register (composed of DPH for the higher byte and DPL for the lower byte) used by 8051 to access external memory by storing a 16-bit address.

**Memory Organization in 8051:**
8051 uses a **Harvard architecture**, providing separate program and data memory spaces.
*   **On-chip RAM (Data Memory)**:
    *   **128 bytes of internal RAM**.
    *   It is composed of **four register banks** (00H-1FH), a **16-byte bit-addressable RAM area** (20H-2FH), and a **general-purpose storage area (scratchpad)** (30H-7FH).
    *   The active register bank is indicated by the RS0 and RS1 bits in the PSW.
*   **Special Function Registers (SFRs)**:
    *   A dedicated memory space within the on-chip RAM, occupying 128 memory locations from **80H to FFH**.
    *   It contains **21 different registers**, each designed for a specific task and controlling the microprocessor. These include A, B, DPH, DPL, IE, IP, P0-P3, PCON, PSW, SCON, SBUF, SP, TMOD, TCON, TL0, TH0, TL1, TH1.
*   **On-chip ROM (Program Memory)**:
    *   **4 kilobytes (KB) of internal ROM** for program storage.
    *   Programs are loaded via flash programming and then act as read-only memory.
    *   The internal address range for program memory is **0000H to 0FFFH**.
*   **External Memory Support**:
    *   The 8051 can be designed with or without external memory.
    *   It supports external RAM and ROM.
    *   **Program memory access configurations**:
        *   **Internal and External Memory Combined**: Internal ROM (0000H-0FFFH) is used alongside external memory (1000H-FFFFH, up to 64KB). This configuration requires the **EA (Enable Access) signal to be connected to VCC**.
        *   **External Memory Only**: The entire 64KB address space (0000H-FFFFH) is allocated to external memory. This requires the **EA pin to be connected to VSS (ground)**.
    *   The processor aligns memory addresses based on the EA pin status. External memory interface utilizes Port 0 for lower-order addresses and Port 2 for higher-order addresses. The **PSEN signal** must be used to enable external program memory.

**Input/Output (I/O) Ports:**
The 8051 features **four 8-bit I/O ports**: Port 0, Port 1, Port 2, and Port 3, accounting for **32 peripheral interface pins**. All four ports are bidirectional. Upon reset, the eight pins of an I/O port default to input mode.
*   **Port 0**: Acts as both an input/output pin and, when external memory is connected, as a **multiplexed address/data bus** (carrying lower-order address bytes and data). It has pull-up resistors for output driving during external memory access.
*   **Port 1**: A group of eight pins (IC pins 1-8) primarily used for **bidirectional parallel data transfer**. P1.0 and P1.1 have multifunctional roles for Timer 2.
*   **Port 2**: Eight pins (IC pins 21-28) primarily used for connecting I/O devices. During external memory interfacing, it carries **higher-order address bits** (A_8-A_15). In normal operations, it carries data and SFR contents.
*   **Port 3**: Eight pins that can be used as a group for I/O or individually as multifunctional pins. Its specific individual functions include:
    *   P3.0: Serial input (RXD)
    *   P3.1: Serial output (TXD)
    *   P3.2: External interrupt 0 (INT0)
    *   P3.3: External interrupt 1 (INT1)
    *   P3.4: Timer 0 external input (T0)
    *   P3.5: Timer 1 external input (T1)
    *   P3.6: External data memory write strobe (WR bar)
    *   P3.7: External data memory read strobe (RD bar)

**Configuring I/O Ports:**
*   To configure a port as **output**, write a '0' to its latch.
*   To configure a port as **input**, write a '1' to its latch.
*   Example: `MOV P1, FFH` configures Port 1 for input mode.
*   Read and write operations involve changing the value of the port latch. Port latches are sampled at the final cycle of an instruction, and the bit status is buffered.

**Timers/Counters:**
The 8051 has **two 16-bit timers**, Timer 0 and Timer 1. They are used for:
*   Providing delays in tasks.
*   Timestamping and triggering interrupts.
*   Generating waveforms and controlling motors.
*   Configured by the **TMOD (Timer/Counter Mode Control) register** and controlled by the **TCON (Timer Control) register**.
*   **TCON (8-bit SFR)** controls and indicates overflow for both timers. Key bits include:
    *   **C/T bar**: Selects counter (1) or timer (0) mode.
    *   **M1, M0**: Select one of four timer modes (Mode 0 to Mode 3).
    *   **TR0, TR1**: Run control bits for Timer 0 and Timer 1, respectively.
    *   **TF0, TF1**: Overflow flags for Timer 0 and Timer 1, respectively.

**Interrupts:**
Microcontrollers respond to events using **interrupts** to avoid wasting processor time with polling.
*   The 8051 has **five vectored interrupts** (excluding reset): three internal and two external.
*   When an interrupt request is sensed, the microcontroller switches control from the main program to an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**.
*   Interrupts are configured using the **IE (Interrupt Enable) register** and **IP (Interrupt Priority) register**, both part of the SFRs.
    *   **IE Register (8-bit SFR)**: Enables individual interrupts (e.g., external interrupts, timer overflows, serial port interrupts). The **EA (Enable All) bit (IE.7)** must be set to 1 for other interrupt enable bits to be effective.
    *   **IP Register (8-bit SFR)**: Sets priority levels for the interrupts.

**Stack and Stack Pointer (SP):**
*   The **stack** is a temporary storage area within the 8051's internal RAM for quick data storage and retrieval.
*   The **Stack Pointer (SP)** is an **8-bit register** (SFR address 81H) that holds the address of the top-most filled location in the stack memory.
*   Initially, the SP holds the address **07H** of the RAM memory.
*   **Stack Operation**:
    *   **PUSH instructions** increment the SP *before* data is stored, causing the stack to **grow upwards** in memory.
    *   **POP instructions** retrieve the top stack content and then decrement the SP.
*   The stack is used during **CALL instructions** (subroutines), which include **L Call (long call, 3 bytes)** and **A Call (absolute call, 2 bytes)**. These preserve the program counter contents.
*   Stack allocation should typically use memory locations less than 7FH. The SP address can be re-allocated to a different RAM section.

**Serial Communication (SBUF & SCON):**
*   **SBUF (Serial Buffer Register)**: An 8-bit SFR (address 99H) used to support serial communication. There are separate SBUF registers for transmission and reception.
*   **SCON (Serial Control Register)**: An SFR (address 98H) that supports **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)** functionality. It sets the mode of serial communication, defines the baud rate, and manages serial interrupts.
    *   **SM0, SM1 bits**: Select one of four serial communication modes (e.g., 8-bit shift register, 8-bit UART, 9-bit UART with varying baud rates).
    *   **REN (Receiver Enable)**: Enables serial reception.
    *   **TI (Transmit Interrupt Flag)** and **RI (Receive Interrupt Flag)**: Indicate transmission/reception completion or buffer readiness.

**Power Control (PCON):**
*   **PCON (Power Mode Control Register)**: An 8-bit SFR (address 87H) used for power management. Key bits include:
    *   **SMOD (Serial Rate Modify bit)**.
    *   **PD (Power Down bit)**.
    *   **IDL (Idle Mode bit)**.

### 8051 Performance and Limitations

*   **Computational Capacity**: As an 8-bit microcontroller, 8051 handles 8-bit data at a time (limit 0 to 255). Its ALU also has an 8-bit capacity. While faster 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers exist, the 8051's 16-bit address bus determines its memory size.
*   **Speed**: The speed is determined by the clock or crystal frequency, which for 8051 is typically around **8 MHz**, significantly lower than other controllers that can operate at hundreds of MHz. This affects application latency.
*   **Peripheral Support**: With four ports, the 8051 can support a range of I/O devices. However, due to its speed, it **cannot handle a large number of multiple interfaces** (e.g., Ethernet, USB, UART, CAN) in real-time applications, making its peripheral support limited.
*   **Benefits**: Despite limitations, 8051 is attractive due to its **minimal power consumption** compared to 32-bit microcontrollers. Its **processing capacity ranges from 1 MIPS to 4000 MIPS**.
*   **IP-Core**: The **IP-Core for 8051 is open-source and free of cost**, which contributes to its use as an optimal processor choice. An IP-Core refers to the proprietary authority for underlying technologies, ensuring consistency and interoperability in commercial products.

### Simulation Tools

The **EdSim51 D1 simulator** is a tool for learning the 8051 microcontroller.
*   It provides views of the CPU, memory, and I/O panels, including SFRs and control registers.
*   Data memory is visible, and default port configurations are displayed.
*   The simulator schematic shows the connectivity of peripherals, some ports having multiple device connections (e.g., Port 2 with an 8-bit switch and an 8-bit analog-to-digital converter).
*   **Limitation**: The EdSim51 D1 simulator **does not support external memory simulation**. Instructions for external memory access (e.g., MOVX) will increment the program counter but will not perform actual data transfer.
*   It offers clock frequency options to vary simulation speed and various I/O devices like seven-segment displays and motors.
