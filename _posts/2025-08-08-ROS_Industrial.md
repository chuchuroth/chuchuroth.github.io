### What is ROS-Industrial?

ROS-Industrial (ROS-I) is an open-source project that extends the capabilities of the Robot Operating System (ROS) to meet the needs of industrial robotics and manufacturing automation. While ROS originated as a flexible framework for robotics research, primarily in academic and service robotics contexts, ROS-Industrial was developed to bridge the gap between research-grade software and the demands of industrial applications. Launched in 2011 by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), Willow Garage, and Yaskawa-Motoman Robotics, ROS-I builds on the core ROS framework by adding standardized interfaces, drivers, and libraries tailored for industrial hardware like manipulators, grippers, sensors, and device networks. It is supported by the ROS-Industrial Consortium, which includes industry and research partners working to ensure reliability, robustness, and interoperability for industrial use cases.

ROS-I aims to provide a common, hardware-agnostic platform that allows industrial robotics developers to leverage ROS’s advanced features—such as perception, motion planning, and simulation—while meeting industrial requirements like code quality, safety, and compatibility with existing manufacturing systems. Unlike proprietary industrial robot systems, ROS-I promotes an open-source, community-driven approach, enabling faster innovation and broader application development.

### Comparison with ROS: Concepts and Operations Transferability

Since ROS-Industrial is built directly on top of ROS, the two share a significant amount of commonality in concepts and operations. However, there are differences in focus, design goals, and additional features that affect how much can be transferred between them. Below is an analysis of key ROS concepts and how they relate to ROS-Industrial, along with the degree of transferability:

#### 1. Core Concepts
- **Nodes**: In both ROS and ROS-I, nodes are individual processes that perform specific tasks (e.g., sensor reading, motion control). These are fully transferable, as ROS-I uses the same node-based architecture.
- **Topics and Messages**: Both systems use publish-subscribe communication via topics and standardized message formats. ROS-I extends this with industrial-specific message types (e.g., for joint trajectories or robot states), but the underlying mechanism is identical and transferable.
- **Services**: Synchronous request-reply communication via services works the same way in both ROS and ROS-I, with full transferability.
- **Parameters**: The parameter server for configuration data is a shared feature, fully compatible between the two.
- **Master**: The ROS Master, which manages name resolution and communication, is unchanged in ROS-I, ensuring seamless transferability.

#### 2. Computation Graph
- The peer-to-peer network structure of ROS, known as the Computation Graph, is preserved in ROS-I. Nodes in ROS-I can communicate with ROS nodes across machines, making the operational model highly transferable. For example, a ROS node processing sensor data can interact with an ROS-I node controlling an industrial robot without modification.

#### 3. Tools
- **ROS Tools (e.g., roslaunch, rostopic, rviz, gazebo)**: Tools for launching nodes, monitoring topics, visualizing data, and simulating environments are largely the same in ROS-I. ROS-I users can directly apply these tools to industrial applications, though some (like rviz) may require industrial-specific configurations or plugins.
- **Simulation**: Gazebo, a common ROS simulator, is widely used in both contexts. ROS-I often integrates it with industrial robot models (e.g., via URDF files), so simulation workflows are transferable with minor adjustments.

#### 4. Packages and Libraries
- **Core ROS Packages**: Packages like `roscpp`, `rospy`, and `tf` (for coordinate transforms) are foundational to both ROS and ROS-I, offering full transferability.
- **ROS-I Additions**: ROS-I introduces packages like `industrial_core`, `simple_message`, and vendor-specific drivers (e.g., for ABB, Fanuc, or Universal Robots manipulators). These are tailored for industrial hardware and not directly applicable to general ROS unless similar hardware is involved. However, the modular package structure means ROS users can adopt ROS-I packages if needed.
- **MoveIt!**: The motion planning framework is heavily used in both ROS and ROS-I. While ROS-I customizes MoveIt! for industrial manipulators (e.g., with specific inverse kinematics solvers), the core concepts and operations remain transferable.

#### 5. Filesystem Structure
- Both ROS and ROS-I organize software into packages, workspaces, and launch files using the catkin build system (ROS 1) or colcon (ROS 2). This structure is identical, so workflows for development, building, and deployment are fully transferable.

#### 6. Key Differences and Transferability Limits
- **Focus and Reliability**: ROS is designed for flexibility and experimentation, often prioritizing rapid prototyping over robustness. ROS-I emphasizes industrial-grade reliability, with stricter code quality standards (e.g., automated testing, documentation) and support for safety-critical systems. While ROS code can be used in ROS-I, it may need hardening for industrial deployment.
- **Hardware Interfaces**: ROS-I provides standardized drivers and interfaces (e.g., `industrial_robot_client`) for industrial robots, which are not typically part of core ROS. General ROS users working with non-industrial hardware (e.g., mobile robots) may not need these, limiting their direct transferability.
- **Middleware**: In ROS 1, both use a custom TCP-based middleware, while ROS 2 (and modern ROS-I) adopts DDS (Data Distribution Service) for real-time performance. Concepts remain consistent, but operational details (e.g., QoS settings) differ slightly and may require adjustment when transferring between ROS 1 and ROS 2-based ROS-I.

#### 7. Operational Transferability
- **Development Workflow**: Writing nodes, creating packages, and debugging with tools like `rosbag` or `rqt` are nearly identical in both systems. A developer familiar with ROS can transition to ROS-I with minimal retraining.
- **Applications**: ROS applications (e.g., navigation, perception) can often be adapted for ROS-I by integrating industrial hardware drivers. Conversely, ROS-I applications (e.g., pick-and-place tasks) can be ported to ROS with appropriate hardware abstraction.
- **Community and Resources**: Both benefit from the broader ROS ecosystem (e.g., tutorials, forums), but ROS-I has additional industry-focused resources via the ROS-Industrial Consortium.

#### Degree of Transferability
- **Concepts**: ~95% transferable. The foundational ideas (nodes, topics, etc.) are identical, with ROS-I adding industrial-specific extensions.
- **Operations**: ~85-90% transferable. Most workflows and tools carry over, but industrial hardware integration and reliability requirements may necessitate adjustments.
- **Code**: ~70-80% transferable. Core ROS code works in ROS-I, but industrial-specific packages or customizations may not apply to general ROS contexts without modification.

### Conclusion
ROS-Industrial is a specialized extension of ROS, not a separate system, so the majority of ROS concepts and operations transfer directly to ROS-I. The primary differences lie in ROS-I’s focus on industrial hardware support, reliability, and standardization, which add layers of functionality rather than replacing ROS fundamentals. A developer or researcher moving between ROS and ROS-I can leverage their existing knowledge, with the main adjustment being familiarity with industrial-specific packages and practices. This high degree of compatibility makes ROS-I a powerful tool for applying ROS’s strengths to manufacturing while retaining the flexibility of the broader ROS ecosystem.
