    *   **Optical Encoder Components**:
        *   **Light Emitting Diode (LED)**: Commonly infrared, sometimes colored LEDs or laser diodes for high performance. A convex lens makes the emitted light parallel.
        *   **Photosensors**: Detect optical pulse signals.
        *   **Code Wheel**: A disc with radial slits or holes.
            *   **Materials**: Metal (industrial, high resistance to vibration, temperature, humidity), Resin (low cost, mass-produced, consumer products), Glass (high precision, high resolution).
        *   A fixed slit can be placed to ascertain light beam transition or blocking.
    *   **Encoder Groups**:
        *   **Absolute Encoders**:
            *   **Function**: Continuously gauge an object's location relative to a reference point. Detect absolute position from a home position in response to microcomputer instructions.
            *   **Output**: Digital code format (binary code) or analog voltage.
            *   **Structure**: Multiple rows of slits (e.g., 4 rows for 16 angles, 5 for 32, 8 for 256). Increasing rows enhances angle change precision.
            *   **Cost**: Higher production cost due to multiple slit rows.
            *   **Output Methods**: Parallel output (binary code through multiple signal lines) or Serial output (single signal line, sequentially switching parallel output lines).
        *   **Incremental Encoders**:
            *   **Function**: Measure the **change in position** (not absolute position). Cannot determine the position of a known reference.
            *   **Output**: Digital pulse signal (relative angle detection type). The number of pulses indicates angular change.
            *   **Resolution**: Increases with more slits or pulses per rotation.
            *   **Structure**: Typically one or two rows of slits (for pseudo-absolute).
            *   **Cost**: Low cost construction.
    *   **Applications**: Devices requiring high speed and high precision, such as industrial robots (machining centers, welding robots, autonomous-guided machines, assembly robots).
*   **Resolvers and Synchros**:
    *   **Utility**: Provide accurate angular and rotational data in challenging production situations.
    *   **Principle**: Rotating transformers where a single rotor rotates within a fixed stator. Rotor winding is excited by an AC reference voltage (a few kilohertz). The magnitude of the voltage induced in any stator winding is determined by the sine of the angle between the rotor and stator coil axes.
    *   **Synchro Specifics**: Stator has three windings separated by 120 degrees and electrically Y-connected.
    *   **Resolver Specifics**: Stator has two windings at a 90-degree angle; primary winding on stator, secondary on rotor.
    *   **Measurement Capability**: Primarily rotary position, but can monitor linear position when combined with lead screws.
*   **Inductosyn**:
    *   **Utility**: Directly measures linear position with accuracy, well-suited for industrial settings.
    *   **Components**: Two magnetically connected pieces: a **scale** (fixed, e.g., to a machine tool bed) and a **slider** (glides along the scale, e.g., with the machine tool carrier).
    *   **Scale Structure**: Insulating layer bonded to a printed circuit trace in a rectangular waveform pattern with a cyclic pitch of a few millimeters.
    *   **Slider Structure**: Has two identical printed circuit traces with the same cyclic pitch as the scale, but one trace is one quarter of a cycle behind the other.
    *   **Operation**: Mirrors a resolver's operation. When a sine wave is applied to the scale, it couples to the two slider windings, producing voltages proportional to the sine and cosine of the slider's spacing within the scale's cyclic pitch.
    *   **Accuracy**: Small inaccuracies in conductor spacing have minor effects because slider output signals are averaged from multiple spatial cycles, which is significant for high accuracy.
*   **Rectilinear Encoders (Moire Fringes)**:
    *   **Structure**: Uses rectangular flat plates instead of revolving discs. Consists of a translucent plate with opaque designs (mask plate) and a moving transparent plate (code plate). Both plates have evenly spaced parallel lines.
    *   **Principle**: Light passes through overlapping transparent areas. Photosensors produce a pulse train as one plate moves, allowing calculation of rectilinear displacement and velocity, similar to an incremental encoder.
    *   **Moire Fringes**: Form as alternating light and dark patterns when the plates overlap. Used to quantify rigid body movements and detect rotation of an index plate relative to a reference plate by sensing fringe line orientation.
    *   **Resolution**: Capable of very small resolutions (0.002 mm) due to finer line spacing.
