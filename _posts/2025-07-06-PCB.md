下面将之前关于“将电路分析技术转化为日常语言”的两部分回答，完整翻译成中文。

---

## 一、将电路分析技术转化为日常场景的比喻

当你在设计 PCB 布局时，不要把这些“看似深奥”的电路分析方法当作抽象的数学公式，而要把它们想象成你熟悉的日常场景。这样，每次需要用到它们时，就能产生具体的联想和画面感。

### 1. 基本定律：PCB 的“交通规则”

1. **欧姆定律（V = I·R）**

   * **日常联想：** 花园水管里的水流

     * 电压 → 水压
     * 电流 → 流量
     * 电阻 → 水管的粗细或折叠处
   * **感觉：** 增加水压（电压）就能提高流量（电流），但如果管道太窄（电阻高），流量仍受限。

2. **基尔霍夫电流定律（KCL）**

   * **日常联想：** 房间里进出的人数平衡
   * **感觉：** 想象一条走廊：进来的人要么留在房间里，要么从别的门出去，总和始终平衡。PCB 上每个节点的电流“进—出”也必须保持平衡。

3. **基尔霍夫电压定律（KVL）**

   * **日常联想：** 绕街走一圈，高度（海拔）上下的总和为零
   * **感觉：** 沿闭合回路走一圈，所有“抬升”和“下落”（电压升降）相加为零。PCB 中沿电源—地回路追踪时，推力和降压总和也会抵消。

---

### 2. 电路简化：把丛林变成花园小径

1. **串联电阻与电压分配**

   * **日常联想：** 一串水过滤器
   * **感觉：** 每个过滤器（电阻）分压，你可以借此准确“取水压”——比如给传感器或芯片供电。

2. **并联电阻与电流分配**

   * **日常联想：** 高速公路分成多条车道
   * **感觉：** 车（电流）根据每条车道（支路）的“宽度”（低电阻）分散行驶，通道越多，运载量越大。

3. **星三角变换（Y–Δ）**

   * **日常联想：** 把三叉路口的 Y 形改成三角环路
   * **感觉：** 有时 Y 路口分析太繁琐，变成 Δ 环就能让每条“马路”独立思考。

4. **源变换（电压源↔电流源）**

   * **日常联想：** 把水龙头+细管换成等效的喷头+并联管道
   * **感觉：** 只要下游表现相同，你可以随意替换“泵+管”或“喷头+并管”，看哪个更好用。

---

### 3. 系统化分析：蓝图和清单

1. **节点分析（Nodal）**

   * **日常联想：** 管理月度家庭开销
   * **感觉：** 把每个“账户”（节点）列出来，保证“收入＝支出”。支路多或有电流源时最合适。

2. **回路分析（Mesh）**

   * **日常联想：** 跑道上的跑者绕各圈计数
   * **感觉：** 给 PCB 画出网格回路，统计每圈“推动力”总和。平面回路、多电压源时更直接。

3. **直接察看法**

   * **日常联想：** 一眼就能认出常见的食谱
   * **感觉：** 如果只有独立电流源（节点）或独立电压源（回路），可直接写出方程，无需重推。

---

### 4. 电路定理：一把“一键解决”神器

1. **叠加原理**

   * **日常联想：** 交响乐中分别听各乐器，然后合起来
   * **感觉：** 每次只开启一个信号源，测出效果后再累加。

2. **戴维南定理（Thevenin）**

   * **日常联想：** 把复杂水管网简化为“一个泵+一根管”的等效组合
   * **感觉：** 只关心“泵压力＝5 psi，管道摩擦＝2 单位”，下游接任何装置都易于估算。

3. **诺顿定理（Norton）**

   * **日常联想：** 把复杂水管网简化为“一个恒流喷头+并管网”
   * **感觉：** 有时把源看成“流量+并联电阻”更直观。

4. **最大功率传输定理**

   * **日常联想：** 骑自行车：档位太轻→蹬得快却没力，太重→蹬不动；刚好→最省力
   * **感觉：** 负载电阻=源内电阻时（RL=RTh），把所有“人力”都转化为“前进动力”，但会更耗热量。

5. **对偶原理**

   * **日常联想：** 模具和雕塑互为对偶，一个凹下去另一个凸起
   * **感觉：** 电压↔电流、串联↔并联、开路↔短路，翻转思路即可。

6. **Parseval 定理**

   * **日常联想：** 喝奶昔：

     1. 直接品尝（时域能量）
     2. 看配方（频域成分）
   * **感觉：** 总“甜度”（功率）不管是直接喝还是按配方计算，都是一样的。

## 二、将“电路定理”解释的比喻翻译

把以下定理用更通俗的比喻再说一次，方便记忆：

1. **叠加原理**

   * **比喻：** 房间里有两台音乐播放器

     1. 先静音一台，只听第一台
     2. 再静音另一台，只听第二台
     3. 最后同时打开，两者声音叠加起来就是最终效果
   * **应用：** PCB 上多个电源时，分别“开”“关”来算各自贡献，再相加。

2. **戴维南定理**

   * **比喻：** 把复杂的管网简化为“一台恒压泵 + 一根有摩擦的管”
   * **意义：** 下游负载看“一个电压源+串联电阻”，轻松估算负载电压和电流。

3. **诺顿定理**

   * **比喻：** 把复杂管网简化为“一股恒定水流 + 并联管道”
   * **关联：** 与戴维南等价，IN = VTh/RTh，RN=RTh。

4. **最大功率传输定理**

   * **比喻：** 骑自行车调档位——档位合适时效率最高
   * **DC 情况：** RL=RTh
   * **AC 情况：** 负载阻抗为源阻抗的共轭（RL=RTh，XL=−XTh）。

5. **对偶原理**

   * **比喻：** 模具与雕塑对调，一个凹的地方另一个就凸
   * **限制：** 只对平面电路有效，不适用于功率、互感等。

6. **Parseval 定理**

   * **比喻：** 奶昔两看法：直接品尝（时域） vs. 看配方（频域）
   * **意义：** 信号总能量在时间和频率域中保持一致。

---

这样，用“水管”、“音乐播放器”、“自行车档位”、“奶昔配方”等具体画面来替代抽象公式，就能在 PCB 设计时快速调取这些定理和分析技巧了。

When you’re laying out a PCB, it helps to think of these “heavy” circuit‐analysis tools not as abstract math, but as everyday scenarios you already understand. Below, each technique is restated in plain‐English stories and images so that when you reach for it in the design process, you’ll feel what you’re doing—rather than just writing equations.

---

## 1. Basic Laws: The “Traffic Rules” of Your PCB

1. **Ohm’s Law (V = I·R)**

   * **Everyday image**: Water through a garden hose.

     * Voltage → water pressure
     * Current → flow rate (liters per minute)
     * Resistance → hose width or a kink in the hose
   * **Feeling**: Increase pressure (voltage) and you get more flow (current)—unless the hose is narrow (high resistance), then only a trickle gets through.

2. **Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)**

   * **Everyday image**: People entering and leaving a room must balance.
   * **Feeling**: Imagine a busy hallway: every person who comes in either stays, leaves through another door, or both. No one vanishes—what goes in must come out or stay inside. When placing nets on your PCB, you know the “traffic” of electrons at each junction must balance.

3. **Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)**

   * **Everyday image**: Walking around a block always brings you back to your starting point.
   * **Feeling**: Sum all the “ups” and “downs” (voltage gains and drops) around the loop—when you’ve gone full circle, your net altitude change is zero. On a board, if you trace power and ground traces around a loop, the total “push” and “pull” cancel out.

---

## 2. Circuit Simplification: Turning a Jungle into Garden Paths

1. **Series Resistors & Voltage Division**

   * **Everyday image**: A line of water filters.
   * **Feeling**: Each filter (resistor) drops part of the pressure—if you know the ratios, you can tap off exactly the right pressure (voltage) for your sensor or IC.

2. **Parallel Resistors & Current Division**

   * **Everyday image**: Splitting a highway into multiple lanes.
   * **Feeling**: Cars (current) spread out across lanes (branches) inversely to how “wide” (low resistance) each lane is. More lanes, more flow capacity.

3. **Wye–Delta (Y–Δ) Transformations**

   * **Everyday image**: Reconfiguring a three‐way street intersection from a Y‑junction to a triangle road.
   * **Feeling**: Sometimes a direct Y‑junction is tricky for traffic (analysis); convert it into a loop, and you can think of each street in isolation.

4. **Source Transformation**

   * **Everyday image**: Swapping a faucet (voltage source + series pipe restriction) for an equivalent sprinkler head (current source + parallel nozzle).
   * **Feeling**: If you understand the end‐result pressure or flow, you can swap one setup for the other without changing how your device downstream behaves.

---

## 3. Systematic Methods: Blueprints & Checklists

1. **Nodal Analysis**

   * **Everyday image**: Budgeting your monthly expenses by category.
   * **Feeling**: You list every “account” (node) and make sure money in equals money out. Great when you have many spending streams (parallel branches) or unknown budgets to solve for.

2. **Mesh Analysis**

   * **Everyday image**: Tracking the flow of runners around each lap of a track.
   * **Feeling**: You draw imaginary loops (meshes) on your board, then tally the net “push” around each loop. Best when your design is mostly series loops (planar) without too many cross‑overs.

3. **By-Inspection Shortcuts**

   * **Everyday image**: Spotting a standard recipe in a cookbook at a glance.
   * **Feeling**: If it’s a simple pattern—only current sources, only voltage sources—you can write the budget or lap‐count equation instantly, without re‑deriving every time.

---

## 4. Circuit Theorems: Special “One‐Stop” Tools

1. **Superposition**

   * **Everyday image**: Hearing multiple instruments in an orchestra—listen to each separately (mute the rest), then add what you heard.
   * **Feeling**: Turn off all but one source, solve, repeat, then sum.

2. **Thevenin & Norton Equivalents**

   * **Everyday image**: Replacing an entire vending machine by a single coin slot (voltage source) plus its internal friction (series resistor), or a coin return slot (current source) plus friction in parallel.
   * **Feeling**: Collapse complex parts of your PCB into a simple “what the outside world sees,” so you can focus on that one load or sensor.

3. **Maximum Power Transfer**

   * **Everyday image**: Tuning a bicycle gear so that the chain engages perfectly—any tighter and it stalls; any looser and you lose power.
   * **Feeling**: Adjust your load resistance to match the board’s “internal stiffness” so you squeeze out maximum juice, but be aware you’re giving up efficiency.

4. **Duality Principle**

   * **Everyday image**: Swapping roles in a play—painter becomes canvas, canvas becomes painter—yet the scene works the same.
   * **Feeling**: For every voltage‑driven scenario, there’s a mirror current‑driven one—swap perspectives when it makes insight pop.

5. **Parseval’s Theorem**

   * **Everyday image**: Comparing a song’s loudness by looking at the sheet music (frequency) versus playing it aloud (time).
   * **Feeling**: Total energy is preserved whether you view it as time‐based wiggles or frequency “notes.”

---

## 5. Time‑ & Frequency‑Domain Techniques: Movies vs. Stills

1. **First‑Order (RC/RL) Responses**

   * **Everyday image**: Filling (or draining) a bathtub through a restrictive faucet.
   * **Feeling**: The level rises (voltage) slowly in an S‑shaped curve—initial burst, gradual tail. You track the “half‑fill time” (time constant).

2. **Second‑Order (RLC) Responses**

   * **Everyday image**: Plucking a guitar string—it oscillates, then fades.
   * **Feeling**: Under‑damped (ring), critically damped (smooth settle), or over‑damped (slow, no ring)—pick the “tone” you want.

3. **Sinusoidal Steady‑State & Phasors**

   * **Everyday image**: Rotating clock hands instead of watching every tick.
   * **Feeling**: Represent sine waves as arrows spinning in a circle; you then add them just like vectors.

---

## 6. Advanced Techniques: The High‑Power Studio

1. **Laplace Transform**

   * **Everyday image**: Translating a novel into a summary of plot points and characters—no need to read every page to know the arc.
   * **Feeling**: Turn differential equations into algebra: solve for “s‑domain” behavior, then translate back.

2. **Fourier Series & Transform**

   * **Everyday image**: Breaking a smoothie into its fruit ingredients by flavor.
   * **Feeling**: Any repeating (or one‑time) waveform is just a mix of pure sine “colors.” See the color spectrum of your signal.

3. **Two‑Port Networks**

   * **Everyday image**: Describing a hotel by only its check‑in desk and room key policies—guests don’t need the back‑office details.
   * **Feeling**: Model amplifiers or filters as black boxes with easy‑to‑measure “in versus out” parameters.

4. **State‑Variable Method**

   * **Everyday image**: Tracking every player’s position on a soccer field at once, updating as the game flows.
   * **Feeling**: Write a dynamic “scoreboard” of all inductor currents and capacitor voltages; then update them in lockstep.

---

### Bringing It to Your PCB Workflow

* **Start with the big picture** (KCL/KVL) as your design “street map.”
* **Simplify** clusters of parts into single “super‑blocks” (Thévenin/Norton) to see how your key sections interact.
* **Use time/frequency tools** when dealing with filters, oscillators, or power‑up transients—pick the bathtub or guitar analogy to guide component choices.
* **Lean on superposition or simulations** to mix and match sources without rewriting your whole analysis.

By feeling these as everyday scenes—hose pressure, road networks, budget ledgers—you’ll instinctively pick the right analysis tool and lay out your PCB with clear, concrete intentions rather than abstract formulas.

---

## circuit analysis techniques:

1.  **Basic Laws**: These are the foundational principles upon which all other analysis techniques are built.
    *   **Ohm's Law**: Relates voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit element.
    *   **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**: States that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero. It is based on the law of conservation of charge. KCL is fundamental to nodal analysis.
    *   **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)**: States that the algebraic sum of voltages around a closed path is zero. KVL is fundamental to mesh analysis.

2.  **Circuit Simplification Techniques**: These methods are used to reduce the complexity of circuits.
    *   **Series Resistors and Voltage Division**: Techniques for combining resistors connected in series and determining voltage distribution across them.
    *   **Parallel Resistors and Current Division**: Techniques for combining resistors connected in parallel and determining current distribution among them.
    *   **Wye-Delta Transformations (or Delta-Wye Transformations)**: Methods to transform three-terminal resistor networks between Wye (Y) and Delta ($\Delta$) configurations. This technique can also be extended to capacitors and inductors and impedance in AC circuits.
    *   **Source Transformation**: The process of replacing a voltage source in series with a resistor by an equivalent current source in parallel with the same resistor, or vice versa. This applies to both independent and dependent sources.

3.  **Systematic Analysis Methods**: These provide structured approaches for solving complex circuits.
    *   **Nodal Analysis (Node-Voltage Method)**: A general procedure for analyzing circuits by systematically applying KCL at non-reference nodes to find unknown node voltages. It can handle circuits with voltage sources by using the concept of a **supernode**. Nodal analysis is applicable to both planar and nonplanar circuits. It is often preferred for networks with many parallel-connected elements, current sources, or supernodes. It is also more amenable to computer solution.
    *   **Mesh Analysis (Loop Analysis or Mesh-Current Method)**: A general procedure for analyzing planar circuits by systematically applying KVL around meshes to find unknown mesh currents. It can handle circuits with current sources by using the concept of a **supermesh**. Mesh analysis is limited to **planar circuits**. It is often preferred for networks with many series-connected elements, voltage sources, or supermeshes.
    *   **Nodal and Mesh Analyses by Inspection**: A shortcut approach for directly writing node-voltage or mesh-current equations based on the circuit's configuration, particularly useful when circuits have only independent current sources (for nodal) or independent voltage sources (for mesh).

4.  **Circuit Theorems**: These theorems provide alternative methods to simplify and analyze linear circuits.
    *   **Linearity Property**: States that the response of a linear circuit is linearly proportional to the input (e.g., if input doubles, output doubles). This principle underpins the validity of superposition.
    *   **Superposition Theorem**: States that the voltage across (or current through) an element in a linear circuit with multiple independent sources is the algebraic sum of the contributions from each independent source acting alone. Dependent sources are always left intact. For AC circuits with different frequencies, the time-domain responses must be summed.
    *   **Thevenin's Theorem**: States that a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source ($V_{Th}$) in series with a resistor ($R_{Th}$). $V_{Th}$ is the open-circuit voltage, and $R_{Th}$ is the equivalent resistance when independent sources are turned off (or found by applying a test source if dependent sources are present). This theorem also applies to AC circuits using Thevenin impedance ($Z_{Th}$).
    *   **Norton's Theorem**: States that a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source ($I_N$) in parallel with a resistor ($R_N$). $I_N$ is the short-circuit current, and $R_N$ is the equivalent resistance (same as $R_{Th}$). Norton's and Thevenin's theorems are related by source transformation ($I_N = V_{Th} / R_{Th}$). This theorem also applies to AC circuits using Norton impedance ($Z_N$).
    *   **Maximum Power Transfer Theorem**: States that for DC circuits, maximum power is transferred to a load when the load resistance equals the Thevenin resistance ($R_L = R_{Th}$). For AC circuits, maximum average power is transferred when the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the Thevenin impedance ($Z_L = Z_{Th}^*$).
    *   **Duality Principle**: Asserts a parallelism between pairs of characterizing equations and theorems of electric circuits, allowing the solution of one circuit to provide the solution for its dual by interchanging complementary elements (e.g., voltage and current, resistance and conductance, capacitance and inductance). This principle is limited to planar circuits and does not apply to power.
    *   **Parseval's Theorem**: Relates the total energy or average power of a signal in the time domain to its representation in the frequency domain (Fourier series or transform).

5.  **Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain Specific Techniques**:
    *   **First-Order Circuit Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing RC and RL circuits, including source-free responses (natural response) and step responses, by solving first-order differential equations. Key concepts include finding initial and final values.
    *   **Second-Order Circuit Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing RLC circuits (series and parallel), including source-free responses and step responses, by solving second-order differential equations. Crucial steps involve determining initial conditions and their derivatives.
    *   **Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis**: Using **phasors** to transform AC circuits from the time domain to the frequency domain, allowing the application of DC circuit analysis techniques (like nodal, mesh, superposition, Thevenin/Norton) but with complex numbers (impedances and admittances).

6.  **Advanced Analysis Techniques**:
    *   **Laplace Transform**: A powerful method that transforms differential equations in the time domain into algebraic equations in the s-domain, greatly simplifying the solution process for circuits with various inputs and responses. It automatically includes initial conditions.
    *   **Fourier Series**: A technique for expressing periodic, nonsinusoidal functions as a sum of sinusoids, allowing the application of phasor methods and superposition to analyze circuits with such excitations. Includes trigonometric and exponential forms.
    *   **Fourier Transform**: Extends Fourier series to non-periodic functions, providing a frequency-domain representation useful for circuit analysis.
    *   **Two-Port Network Analysis**: Characterizing a network by relating its terminal voltages and currents using various parameters (e.g., Z-parameters, Y-parameters, H-parameters, Transmission parameters). This treats the network as a "black box" and is useful for cascaded designs and modeling devices like transistors.
    *   **State Variable Method**: A tool for analyzing systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, often using inductor currents and capacitor voltages as state variables to derive first-order differential equations.

Let’s recast each of these theorems into everyday stories and images, so you can “feel” what’s happening when you use them on your PCB designs.

---

### 1. Superposition Theorem

**Everyday image:**  Imagine you’re in a room with two music players, each playing its own tune.

* **Step 1:** Mute one player and listen to the first alone.
* **Step 2:** Mute the other and listen to the second alone.
* **Step 3:** Now turn them both on—the final sound you hear is just the sum of those two solo recordings.

**Feeling:** You don’t try to listen to both at once from the start. You isolate each source of “sound” (voltage or current), figure out its effect, then add them together. On your PCB, if you have multiple power rails or signal injectors, you can treat each one separately, then combine their effects at the node or component you care about.

---

### 2. Thevenin’s Theorem

**Everyday image:**  Picture a complex waterworks system of pipes, valves, and pumps—but all you care about is the fountain at the end. You replace the entire upstream network with:

1. **One single pump** (a fixed pressure source)
2. **One single pipe** of equivalent “tightness” (the series resistance)

**Feeling:** You no longer need to juggle ten valves and loops—just see “pump = 5 psi, pipe = 2 units of friction.” When you connect your fountain (the load), you immediately know how much water pressure and flow it will get, without diving back into the plumbing details.

---

### 3. Norton’s Theorem

**Everyday image:**  Using the same plumbing analogy, but this time you replace the upstream network with:

1. **One single sprinkler head** that sprays a constant flow of water (a current source)
2. **One single mesh of pipes** in parallel (the parallel resistance)

**Feeling:** Instead of thinking “pump + pipe,” you think “flow + parallel path.” It’s just another way to look at the same thing—sometimes easier if your load naturally “draws” a certain flow rather than seeing a pressure drop.

---

### 4. Maximum Power Transfer Theorem

**Everyday image:**  You’re pedaling a bicycle at a fixed effort, and the gearing determines how hard it is to turn the pedals.

* If the gear ratio is too easy (low resistance), you spin too fast but barely move forward (wasted effort).
* If the gear is too hard (high resistance), you barely turn the pedals (stall).
* **Just right gear = perfect match**, so every bit of your pedaling effort is converted into forward motion.

**Feeling:** On your PCB, when you size your load resistor (or input impedance of the next stage) to match the Thevenin resistance of your driver, you squeeze out the most electrical “oomph” into that load—though at the cost of efficiency and heat.

---

### 5. Duality Principle

**Everyday image:**  Think of a plaster mold and the sculpture it creates. The mold’s cavities become the statue’s protrusions, and its ridges become the statue’s recesses. Each is the “dual” of the other.

* **Voltage ↔ Current**,
* **Series ↔ Parallel**,
* **Open circuit ↔ Short circuit**.

**Feeling:** If you’ve solved how electrons “pile up” under pressure in one network, you can instantly write down how they would “flow freely” in the dual network—just swap your picture upside‑down.

---

### 6. Parseval’s Theorem

**Everyday image:**  You order a smoothie made of banana, strawberry, and mango. You can enjoy it two ways:

1. **Taste it all at once** (time domain)—you feel the total sweetness.
2. **List its ingredients** (frequency domain)—you know exactly how much of each fruit went in.

**Feeling:** The total “sweetness” energy you taste is the same no matter whether you sip it straight or check your recipe card. On your PCB, Parseval tells you: the total power in your signal remains the same whether you look at it as a waveform over time or as a spectrum of frequencies.

---

#### How to “use” these in PCB design

* **Superposition:** When multiple supplies or signal injectors converge on one net, turn them on one at a time—sketch each effect, then overlay them.
* **Thevenin/Norton:** Collapse everything upstream of a critical component into a single source + resistor or source ∥ resistor. That makes matching, load‑tuning, and transient estimates straightforward.
* **Max Power Transfer:** If you want brute‑force drive and don’t care about wasted heat (e.g., in a test jig), match load to source. If you care about efficiency, deliberately don’t match.
* **Duality:** If a parallel‑heavy network feels messy, flip it into its series dual—and vice versa.
* **Parseval:** When you design filters or check EMI, remember that taming your waveform distortions in time automatically changes the spectrum—and you can compute total power either way.

By picturing pumps & hoses, music players, bike gears, and smoothie recipes, these “theorems” become intuitive tools in your PCB toolbox—ready to guide impedance matching, load planning, and signal‑integrity decisions with very concrete mental models.

## theorems:

*   **Superposition Theorem**:
    *   **Definition**: The superposition principle states that **the voltage across (or current through) an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages across (or currents through) that element due to each independent source acting alone**.
    *   **Application Method**: To apply superposition, one must consider **one independent source at a time while all other independent sources are turned off**. This means **voltage sources are replaced by 0 V (a short circuit), and current sources by 0 A (an open circuit)**. However, **dependent sources must be left intact** because they are controlled by circuit variables. The process involves three steps: 1) turn off all independent sources except one and find the output due to that active source; 2) repeat for each other independent source; and 3) algebraically add all the contributions.
    *   **Limitations/Considerations**: While it simplifies complex circuits, applying superposition might sometimes involve more work if there are many independent sources. For **AC circuits with sources operating at different frequencies, the total response must be obtained by adding the individual responses in the time domain**, not the phasor or frequency domain.

*   **Thevenin's Theorem**:
    *   **Definition**: Thevenin's theorem states that a **linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source VTh in series with a resistor RTh**.
    *   **Finding VTh**: **VTh is the open-circuit voltage at the terminals**.
    *   **Finding RTh**:
        *   **If the network has no dependent sources**: RTh is the **input resistance of the network looking between the terminals when all independent sources are turned off**.
        *   **If the network has dependent sources**: All independent sources are turned off, but dependent sources are left intact. One must **apply a voltage source (e.g., 1 V) to the terminals and determine the resulting current (io), then RTh = Vo/io**. Alternatively, insert a current source (e.g., 1 A) and find the terminal voltage (Vo), then RTh = Vo/io.
    *   **Significance**: Thevenin's theorem is very important in circuit analysis as it **simplifies a circuit, allowing a large circuit to be replaced by a single independent voltage source and a single resistor**. It's particularly useful when dealing with a variable load. This theorem also applies to **AC circuits by using impedance (ZTh) instead of resistance**.

*   **Norton's Theorem**:
    *   **Definition**: Norton's theorem states that a **linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source IN in parallel with a resistor RN**.
    *   **Finding IN**: **IN is the short-circuit current through the terminals**.
    *   **Finding RN**: **RN is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off**. This is found in the same way as RTh in Thevenin's theorem.
    *   **Relationship to Thevenin's Theorem**: Norton's and Thevenin's theorems are closely related by **source transformation**. Specifically, **RN = RTh** and **IN = VTh / RTh**. Calculating any two of VTh, IN, or RTh allows the third to be determined using Ohm's law. This theorem also applies to **AC circuits**.

*   **Maximum Power Transfer Theorem**:
    *   **Definition (DC)**: For DC circuits, maximum power is transferred to the load when the **load resistance (RL) equals the Thevenin resistance (RTh)** as seen from the load (RL = RTh).
    *   **Definition (AC)**: For AC circuits, maximum average power is transferred to a load when the **load impedance (ZL) is the complex conjugate of the Thevenin impedance (Z*Th)**. This means if ZL = RL + jXL and ZTh = RTh + jXTh, then `RL = RTh` and `XL = -XTh` for maximum power transfer.

*   **Duality Principle**:
    *   **Definition**: This principle **asserts a parallelism between pairs of characterizing equations and theorems of electric circuits**. Two circuits are dual if they are described by the same form of characterizing equations with variables interchanged.
    *   **Usefulness**: If the solution to one circuit is known, the solution for its dual circuit is automatically available.
    *   **Limitations**: It is **limited to planar circuits**. It **does not apply to power**, as power is non-linear. Also, mutual inductance has no dual.

*   **Parseval's Theorem**:
    *   **Definition (for periodic functions)**: This theorem states that the **average power in a periodic signal is the sum of the average power in its DC component and the average powers in its harmonics**. Mathematically, for a 1-ohm resistor, the average power is `P = F_rms^2 = a0^2 + (1/2) * Σ(An^2)` or `P = Σ(|cn|^2)` where `An` and `cn` are Fourier series coefficients.
    *   **Definition (for nonperiodic functions)**: For nonperiodic functions, Parseval's theorem states that the **total energy delivered to a 1-ohm resistor equals the total area under the square of the function in the time domain, or 1/(2π) times the total area under the square of the magnitude of its Fourier transform in the frequency domain**.
    *   **Significance**: It shows that the energy of a nonperiodic signal is spread over the entire frequency spectrum, while the energy of a periodic signal is concentrated at the frequencies of its harmonic components.

While not explicitly called "theorems," the text also mentions:

*   **Law of Conservation of Charge**: This fundamental law is the basis for Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), requiring that the algebraic sum of charges within a system remains constant.
*   **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**: States that the **algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero**.
*   **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)**: States that the **algebraic sum of voltages around a closed path is zero**.
