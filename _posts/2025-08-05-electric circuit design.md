## ‚úÖ PART 1: Example ‚Äì Electric Circuit Design for a Control Panel (Small Factory)

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Application Overview:**

Let‚Äôs assume the control panel is for a **small bottling line** in a food production facility. It includes:

* Conveyor motors (3-phase)
* Bottle filling machine
* Bottle capping machine
* Sensors (photoelectric, level)
* Emergency stop circuit
* HMI and PLC-based control (Siemens S7-1200)
* Basic VFD for speed control
* 24VDC control logic

---

### üóÇÔ∏è **Main Components in the Panel:**

* **Main Circuit Breaker** (3P MCCB 63A)
* **Contactor + Overload Relays** (for each motor)
* **VFD** (for main conveyor motor)
* **24VDC Power Supply** (for PLC, sensors, relays)
* **PLC** ‚Äì Siemens S7-1200 + Digital I/O modules
* **HMI** ‚Äì 7‚Äù touchscreen
* **Mains-to-Control Transformer** (if needed)
* **Terminal Blocks, Relays, Push Buttons, Selector Switches, Indicator Lamps**
* **Emergency Stop Mushroom Buttons**
* **Circuit Breakers (MCBs)** ‚Äì for segmented protection

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PART 2: Common Electrical & Control Failures (from real field experience)

### 1. **Contactor Coil Not Energizing**

* **Cause:** Blown fuse, loose control wire, coil burnout, or PLC output not functioning.
* **How to Test:**

  * Measure 24VDC at the coil terminals.
  * Check continuity of coil.
  * Test PLC output using force/test mode.
* **Fix:** Replace coil/fuse, fix wiring, or use spare PLC output.

---

### 2. **Motor Not Starting / Tripping**

* **Cause:** Overload relay tripped, phase loss, or incorrect VFD parameters.
* **How to Test:**

  * Check overload status.
  * Measure phase voltage.
  * Check VFD fault code.
* **Fix:** Reset overload, fix power supply issue, correct VFD config (e.g., acceleration time, torque limits).

---

### 3. **PLC Not Powering On**

* **Cause:** 24V power supply failure, short circuit in field devices.
* **How to Test:**

  * Measure 24VDC at the power supply.
  * Disconnect field loads and check again.
* **Fix:** Replace shorted device, check PSU loading.

---

### 4. **Sensor Not Detecting / False Signals**

* **Cause:** Dirty lens, incorrect alignment, or electrical noise.
* **How to Test:**

  * Clean sensor, realign, check with handheld tester.
  * Use scope to observe signal integrity.
* **Fix:** Replace sensor, add shielding or filter capacitor.

---

### 5. **PLC I/O Failure**

* **Cause:** Overvoltage, reverse polarity, short circuit.
* **How to Test:**

  * Use test mode to toggle I/O.
  * Measure current draw.
* **Fix:** Replace damaged module, add fuse/diode protection.
