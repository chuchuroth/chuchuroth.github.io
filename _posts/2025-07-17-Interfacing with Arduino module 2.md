### Sensors

**Definition and Purpose**
Sensors are **input devices** that allow an Arduino or IoT device to **perceive the outside world** by receiving information about the environment. They enable the microcontroller to perform different operations based on environmental aspects. All sensor data must eventually come into the microcontroller, where the software code interprets it to make decisions.

**Environmental Conditions Sensed**
Sensors can detect various environmental conditions, ranging from simple events like pressing a button to more complex aspects. Examples include:
*   **Brightness/Light** (e.g., photo sensor/photoresistor).
*   **Sound Volume** (e.g., microphone).
*   **Humidity**.
*   **Barometric Pressure**.
*   **Button Press** (on-off button, keyboard).
*   **Temperature** (e.g., thermistor).
*   **Flex/Bending** (e.g., flex resistor).
*   **Motion** (e.g., PIR motion sensor).
*   **Acceleration** (e.g., Triple Axis Analog Accelerometer).
*   **Angular Velocity** (e.g., Dual Axis Gyroscope).

**How Microcontrollers Interpret Sensor Data**
Microcontrollers, including the Arduino, **only sense voltage**. Sensors must convert the environmental effect they measure into a **voltage value** that the Arduino can read. This voltage can be read digitally (low or high) using `digitalRead()` or as an analog value using `analogRead()` on analog pins.

**Types of Sensors and Interfacing**

*   **Resistive Sensors**
    *   **Description**: These sensors change their resistance based on an environmental effect. Examples include Photoresistors (brightness), Thermistors (temperature), and Flex Resistors (bending).
    *   **Interfacing Challenge**: Microcontrollers do not sense resistance directly; they sense voltage. Therefore, a **circuit must be built around the sensor** to convert resistance changes into voltage changes.
    *   **Voltage Divider Circuit**: A common circuit for resistive sensors is a **voltage divider**, where the sensor acts as one of the resistors. As the sensor's resistance changes due to an environmental effect, the voltage at the point between the two resistors in the divider changes. This voltage is then connected to an analog input pin (e.g., A0-A5) of the Arduino and read using `analogRead()`.
    *   **Photoresistor Example**: If a photoresistor's resistance decreases as brightness increases, the voltage measured in a voltage divider circuit (with the photoresistor as the top resistor and a fixed resistor as the bottom one) will increase, allowing the Arduino to detect light level changes.

*   **Push Buttons**
    *   **Operation**: A push button is a simple switch that **connects or disconnects two terminals**. When pressed, the terminals are connected; when not pressed, they are disconnected.
    *   **Interfacing Challenge**: To read a push button with an Arduino, a circuit must be designed so that pressing the button changes the voltage on an Arduino pin (e.g., one voltage when pressed, another when not pressed).
    *   **Incorrect Circuit**: A simple connection from an Arduino pin to one side of the button and the other side to 5 volts is **incorrect**. While pressing the button makes the pin high, when the button is not pressed, the pin is not connected to anything, causing its voltage to "float" unpredictably.
    *   **Correct Circuit**: A correct circuit wires the Arduino pin **between a resistor and the push button**.
        *   When the button is **pressed**, the Arduino pin is directly connected to 5 volts, making the pin **high**.
        *   When the button is **not pressed**, the Arduino pin is connected to **ground through the resistor**, ensuring the pin goes **low** (zero volts). This design provides a definite high or low voltage for the Arduino to read using `digitalRead()`.

*   **Voltage-Controlling Sensors**
    *   **Description**: These sensors directly **output a specific voltage** that changes according to the environmental effect. They are easier to use because Arduino directly senses voltage.
    *   **Interfacing**: Their voltage output can be connected directly to an analog input of the Arduino and measured.
    *   **PIR Motion Sensor Example**: A Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor has three leads: power, ground, and a signal output. This particular type of sensor **pulls its signal pin low (to zero volts) when motion is detected**. When no motion is detected, it does not actively assign a value, which would lead to a floating voltage.
    *   **Pull-Up Resistor**: To prevent floating when no motion is detected, a **10 K Ohm resistor is used to connect the signal pin to power (plus five volts)**. This "pull-up path" ensures that if the motion sensor is not pulling the pin low, it defaults to a high voltage. This type of sensor behavior (pulling low and floating when inactive) is called "Open-Collector".
    *   **Other Examples**:
        *   **Triple Axis Analog Accelerometer**: Senses acceleration in three dimensions (X, Y, Z) and reports it as voltage, useful for determining device orientation based on gravity.
        *   **Dual Axis Gyroscope**: Reports angular velocity in two dimensions as voltage. Both accelerometers and gyroscopes are commonly used together in devices like quadcopters to sense and maintain orientation.

### Actuators

**Definition and Purpose**
Actuators are **output devices** that **cause something to happen in the real world** based on the microcontroller's commands. They enable IoT devices to produce tangible results.

**Types of Outputs Controlled by Actuators**
Actuators can generate various types of outputs:
*   **Visual**: LEDs, Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs), monitors.
*   **Audio**: Buzzers, speakers.
*   **Motion**: Motors, valves, pumps.
*   **Tactile/Environmental**: Heating and cooling units (e.g., HVAC systems).

**Methods of Actuator Control**

*   **On-Off Actuation (Power Control)**
    *   **Description**: This is the simplest form of control, where the device is either **powered on or off**. It provides minimal control but can be sufficient for certain applications.
    *   **Examples**: Turning an LED off or on, making a buzzer buzz or not buzz, powering a monitor on or off. In systems like classroom lights or HVAC, on-off control is often satisfactory.
    *   **Current Limits**: It is critical to consider the **current limits** of both the microcontroller and the actuator.
        *   **Actuator Limits**: An LED, for instance, might only handle 20 milliamps; exceeding this can damage it. An appropriate resistor in series with the LED helps control the current.
        *   **Microcontroller Limits**: Standard Arduino pins can supply a maximum of **40 milliamps**. If an actuator (e.g., a motor requiring 10-15 amperes) needs more current than the Arduino can supply, an **alternate power supply** (e.g., a large battery) is required. In such cases, the Arduino acts as a switch, controlling access to the external power supply rather than directly powering the actuator.

*   **Analog Control**
    *   **Requirement**: Many actuators require an **analog voltage** to be fully controlled. Examples include controlling the speed of a DC motor (higher voltage = faster speed), adjusting the brightness of an LED, or regulating the heat output of a heating element.
    *   **Arduino Limitation**: Most Arduinos and microcontrollers **cannot directly generate analog voltage outputs**. While there is an `analogWrite()` function, it does not produce a true analog voltage; it generates a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal. The Arduino Due is an exception, capable of direct analog output.
    *   **Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs)**: A separate Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) chip can be connected to a microcontroller to convert digital inputs into equivalent analog voltage values. This is a more expensive and potentially complicated option.

*   **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**
    *   **Purpose**: PWM is a common technique to **"fool" actuators** that typically require analog voltage into responding as if they are receiving an analog signal, even though the Arduino only outputs digital (0V or 5V).
    *   **Mechanism**: A PWM signal is a **square wave** that rapidly alternates between 0 volts and 5 volts. The **perceived average voltage** is controlled by changing the **duty cycle**, which is the percentage of time the signal is high. For example, a 50% duty cycle (high half the time, low half the time) results in a perceived 2.5 volts (for a 5V system), while a 75% duty cycle results in a higher perceived voltage. This works if the actuator does not respond quickly to the rapid changes.
    *   **`analogWrite()` Function**:
        *   Generates a **PWM signal** on a specified pin.
        *   Has a **fixed frequency of 490 Hertz**.
        *   Takes two arguments:
            1.  **Pin number**: The pin on which to generate the PWM signal. Only a **subset of Arduino pins** (marked with a tilde `~`) support PWM.
            2.  **Pulse width/Duty cycle indicator**: A number from **0 to 255**.
                *   `0` means 0% duty cycle (low all the time).
                *   `255` means 100% duty cycle (high all the time).
                *   `127` or `128` represents approximately a 50% duty cycle.
        *   **Application (Fade Example)**: `analogWrite()` is used to control LED brightness by varying the duty cycle. A larger duty cycle results in a brighter LED, and a smaller duty cycle results in a dimmer LED. An example code demonstrates fading an LED brighter and dimmer by incrementally changing the `brightness` argument passed to `analogWrite()` and reversing direction when limits (0 or 255) are reached. A resistor (e.g., 220 ohms) is used in series with the LED.

*   **`tone()` Function for Sound Generation**
    *   **Purpose**: The `tone()` function generates a **square wave with an arbitrary frequency**. It is primarily used for making sounds, such as driving a speaker or buzzer.
    *   **Differences from `analogWrite()`**: Unlike `analogWrite()`, `tone()` **cannot change the duty cycle** (it has a fixed 50% duty cycle), but it can **change the frequency**.
    *   **Arguments**:
        1.  **Pin number**: The pin on which to generate the tone.
        2.  **Frequency (in Hertz)**: The desired frequency of the signal.
        3.  **Duration (in milliseconds)**: An optional argument specifying how long the tone should play. If omitted, the tone plays until `noTone()` is called.
    *   **Sound Quality**: A square wave generated by `tone()` generally **sounds like a buzz** or has annoying high-frequency components due to its sharp edges. This contrasts with a pure sine wave, which produces a pleasing, single-frequency tone but cannot be directly generated by digital microcontrollers.
    *   **Piezo Element**: A **piezo element** (buzzer) is a simple sound-making device used with the `tone()` function. It has two terminals connected to a signal and ground. It produces a "click" or sound on the rising edge of an applied signal. By rapidly clicking at a specific frequency, it generates a tone.
    *   **Application (Music Example)**: The `tone()` function can be used to play sequences of tones. An example circuit connects a piezo element to pin 8 of an Arduino. The code repeatedly calls `tone()` with different frequencies (e.g., 988 Hz and 1047 Hz, representing B and C notes) for a specified duration (e.g., 1000 milliseconds or 1 second), resulting in alternating tones. The `pinMode` for the output pin must be set to `OUTPUT` in the `setup()` function.
