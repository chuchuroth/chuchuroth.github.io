## Robotics: Subsystems, Design, Applications, and Technologies

This document outlines the fundamental aspects of robotics, including industrial robot subsystems, classification, design and selection criteria, energy sources, communication protocols, the Internet of Things (IoT) in robotics, Robotic Operating Systems (ROS), and specific applications in industries like automotive manufacturing, welding, painting, and sheet metal work.

### 1. Industrial Robot Subsystems and Classification

**Industrial robot subsystems** include:
*   **Robot controller system**: Provides logic control and power functions to monitor and control the mechanical structure and communicate with the environment. It contains a motion controller, internal and external communication systems, and power stages. The controller unit is formed by computers and server controller systems that move the robot.
*   **Teaching pendant**: A multifunctional, portable device for programming and teaching a robot. It features an LCD touch panel, an enable button, and an e-stop button, and is linked to the robot's control system.
*   **Manipulator (Mechanical unit)**: A machine that grips or manipulates objects using multiple degrees of freedom or axes. It is a multi-degree of freedom mechanism with revolute or prismatic joints and lacks an end-effector.
*   **Robotic end-effectors (End-Of-Arm-Tooling - EOAT)**: Attached to the robot's wrist. Simple tools use discrete input/output, while complex or advanced tools use industrial communication protocols.
*   **Sensing and vision technologies**: Enable robots to scan the environment. Industrial robots can stop or slow down when humans approach. Vision sensing is performed using LIDAR, radar, or 3D cameras. Collaborative robots (cobots) incorporate a sensor-based safety skin that stops the robot arm upon contact with a human. Robot force and displacement sensors provide feedback to the control system.
*   **Driving system (Actuator unit)**: Comprises drivers and transmission components. Available drivers include electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic types. Harmonic, screw, or gear drives may also be utilized.

**Classification of Robots**:
*   **Based on Application**:
    *   **Industrial robot**: Equipment for industrial automation, capable of automatic movement or rotation around multiple axes. These robots can be mobile or stationary and include hand-guided robots and serial manipulators. Industrial robots have evolved into cobots, designed to collaborate and communicate with people using end-effectors.
    *   **Service robot**: Designed to assist human beings in sectors such as defense, education, households, and hospitals.
*   **Based on Manipulator**:
    *   **Serial manipulators**: Some, like pick-and-place robots, follow simple programs and may not require a feedback system. Welding robots, however, need a feedback system for corrective actions based on input or control variables. The emergence of cobots necessitates feedback systems for these manipulators.
    *   **Parallel manipulators**: Always feature a feedback system, exemplified by the Steward platform. This platform uses a movable triangle (A1, A2, A3) and a stationary platform (B1, B2, B3), driven by six prismatic actuators, providing six degrees of freedom. Parallel manipulators generally offer greater stiffness, precision, and movement speed compared to their serial counterparts, but exhibit less mobility. Consequently, they are commonly employed as machine tools and in flight simulators.

An **industrial robotic system** typically consists of four main systems: **mechanical systems, control systems, drive systems, and sensing systems**. The mechanical system comprises links joined by pin joints to achieve specific movements. The control system is considered the "brain" of the robot.

### 2. Robot Selection and Design Criteria

**General Selection Criteria for any Robot**:
*   **Compact and effective design**: Space-saving, slim-armed, small-footprint, with hidden air and electrical lines to reduce expenditures and wear and tear.
*   **Robot controller features**: Compact size, lightweight, fast processing speed, modular expandability, and integration capabilities with vision systems, PLCs, or other devices.
*   **Cost-effective offline programming software**: Software must be inexpensive and possess necessary features.
*   **Energy consumption**: Slim and lightweight robot arms consume less power, leading to long-term cost savings. Overall, the robot's energy consumption should be low.
*   **Safety**: The robot must meet or exceed all safety codes to protect employees and limit company liability.
*   **Training duration**: Requires short training to save time and money, as unnecessary training wastes resources.
*   **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Robot durability can be confirmed by manufacturer's documentation regarding its MTBF.
*   **Maximum moment of inertia**: The robot should have a maximum permissible moment of inertia for easily lifting and carrying a given payload, which also extends its operational life.
*   **Continuous working cycle time**: Classified as continuous or short period, depending on the application.
*   **Robot manufacturer's reputation**: An essential factor in robot selection.

**Selection Criteria for Industrial Robots** (specifically for industrial and automation applications):
*   **Greater productivity**.
*   **Repeatability and accuracy in operation**.
*   **Energy consumption**.
*   **Payload capacity**.
*   **Maximum reach**.
*   **Mounting position**.
*   **Cutting tool orientation**.
*   **Working or operating environment**.

**General Design Criteria for Building a Robot**:
*   **Work volume**: Defined as the space occupied by the robot. The physical configurations, including size, axes, mounting position (gantry, wall, floor, or tracks), arm and joint limits, and end-effectors, can alter the entire work volume.
*   **Precision in motion**: The robot's ability to move the end of its wrist with high precision, accuracy, repeatability, and spatial resolution.
    *   **Spatial resolution**: The smallest increment of motion controllable by the robot's wrist end, determined by the position control system, feedback measurement, mechanical precision, and accuracy.
*   **Total load carrying capacity**: Manufacturers specify the lifting capacity, which excludes the weight of end-effectors. The typical range is 1.5kg to 910kg. The load carrying capability must exceed the sum of the workpiece weight, end-effector weight, and a safety range.
*   **Robot movement speed**: The end-effector speed is controlled by the robot arm. Acceleration and deceleration impact cycle time, depending on object weight, distance, precision, and robot speed. Load also determines end-effector speed.
*   **Working envelope**: The volume within which the robot operates, defined by the robot arm's structure, the length of each arm element, the type of motion, and the range of each joint.

### 3. End-Effector (Gripper) Selection and Design

**Gripper Selection Factors**:
*   Ability to reach the work part surface.
*   Consideration for changes in part size to ensure accurate position.
*   Prevention of damage to fragile parts.
*   Ability to hold the larger region for increased stability and control if the work part has varying sizes.
*   Incorporation of robust pads for improved work part contact.
*   Availability of interchangeable fingers to grasp different sized work parts.

**Gripper Design Criteria**:
*   **Grip force**: Must be determined based on the total weight of the work part.
*   Ability to hold the workpiece at its center of mass.
*   Consideration of robot arm speed and connectivity.
*   Consideration of gripper and robot arm movement.
*   Consideration of workpiece-gripper position, friction, or physical restriction to ensure the work portion is gripped.
*   Consideration of gripper-workpiece friction.
*   **Part shape**: A two-jaw gripper is typically used for products with two opposing flats, but can be designed to accommodate cylindrical parts. A three-jaw gripper is suitable for cylindrical parts.
*   **Accessibility and part consistency**: Angular grippers with arcing jaws may require tooling clearance if the part profile varies.
*   **Part weight**: Gripping force must be sufficient for lifting the part.
*   **Orientation and dimensions**: The orientation of the part and its distance from the gripper face influence gripper selection.
*   **Size**: The nominal gripping dimension indicates the approximate size of the gripper.
*   **Variation**: Minimum gripper jaw travel is determined by variations in gripping location or encapsulation.
*   **Air pressure**: Air pressure at the gripper affects gripper sizing and must be considered.
*   **Grip direction**: Grip force varies in each direction (grip on, open, or close) due to the effective area of the piston rod on some gripper types; this must be considered during sizing.
*   **Velocity**: Higher speeds and acceleration/deceleration affect gripper selection.
*   **Tool length**: Longer tooling introduces bending moments into the gripper, affecting its sizing.
*   **Tooling configuration**: If the part is encased, less gripping force is required than if it is grasped only on flats.
*   **Product retention**: Due attention must be given to avoid part retention after task completion.
*   **Working environment**: Special platings or materials should be specified for harsh environments.
*   **Synchronous jaw movement**: Most grippers have synchronized jaw movement, but independent jaw travel can be provided upon request.
*   **Switching options**: Most grippers offer multiple switching options.

Gripping action is achieved with the help of **gears, rack and pinion, and sliders**.

### 4. Robot Parameters and Design Template Development

**Standard symbols** are used to represent robot components such as passes, joints, sensors, actuators, and mechanisms.

**Steps for developing a template design for industrial robots**:
1.  **Input Parameters**: The designer feeds static and dynamic parameters into MATLAB Simscape software.
    *   **Static parameters**: Include the number of degrees of freedom, type of kinematic pair (T_kp), maximum load on the end effector (W_ee), minimum length of the robot arm (L_a), type of prime motor (T_ds), type of transmission system (T_tr), type of sensor (T_se), and type of end effector (T_ee). The designer selects necessary static parameters using relevant algorithms.
    *   **Dynamic parameters**: Include angular velocity (omega) and angular acceleration (A).
2.  **Symbol Arrangement**: Standard robotic design symbols (e.g., actuators, couplers, motors, sensors) are arranged systematically to achieve the required output dimensions.
3.  **Modeling and Analysis**: The base, column, robotic arm links, and joints are modeled using software like Ansys. Various analyses are performed, including **workspace, vibration, stress and strain, and kinematic velocity**.
4.  **Finalization**: If all aspects are satisfied, the designer finalizes the design template component list and robot performance list (including workspace, vibration, stress, strain, and kinetic velocity).

**Robot Parameters Calculation**:
*   **Robot payload**: The total weight the robot can carry. This includes both the part and gripper's weight when moving a part. It is measured in pounds or kilograms. A specific formula for calculating robot payload is provided.
*   **Control resolution**: Determined by vectorially summing the joint resolutions. Calculation can be complex due to mixed rotational and sliding joints. Mechanical inconsistencies from robot movements limit spatial resolution. Accuracy is affected by load and arm speed. The formula for control resolution is **(R_max - R_min) / 2^n**, where R is the range or stroke length, and n is the number of bit storage capacity.
*   **Repeatability error**: The difference between a preset target position (P) and where the robot actually returns (R) in successive motion cycles. The robot wrist may not return precisely to P but clusters around it. This clustering around P is termed repeatability error.
*   **Gripping force (P)**: Calculated using the formula **P = w(g+a) / (Mu * FOS)**, where P is the gripping force in Newton, w is the part mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, a is acceleration, Mu is the static friction coefficient, and FOS is the factor of safety. To prevent slipping during static pretensions, the gripping force must be greater than w(g+a) / (Mu * FOS).

### 5. Energy for Robots

**Energy efficiency** is a growing concern in robotics, driven by electronic device development and environmental consciousness. Robots must consume less energy to maintain future growth in the manufacturing industry.

**Energy saving modes for industrial robots**:
*   **Dynamic power modes**.
*   **Smart energy monitoring**.
*   **Novel mechanical processes**.
Today's industrial robots typically include standby and hibernate power modes, switching between them throughout the working day without human interaction. The Internet of Things (IoT) will influence robot energy consumption by providing wireless accessibility and real-time energy consumption data through embedded sensors. Connected power sensors are expected to become standard.
Manufacturers can achieve the same productivity with less power by modifying robot movement and interaction, requiring rejection of traditional mechanical processes. An example is Nike's 2017 implementation of static electric robots that use electro-adhesion to grasp materials, enhancing precision, minimizing moving parts, and reducing energy consumption due to less mechanical motion, resistance, and torque.

**Challenges in Robotic Science and Energy Requirements** include:

*   **Batteries**: The majority of robots use batteries, characterized as rechargeable and non-rechargeable.
    *   **Rechargeable types**: Lead acid, nickel-cadmium, and nickel-metal-hydride.
    *   **Non-rechargeable types**: Alkaline (inexpensive and sufficient for most applications) and lithium (perform better and have a longer lifespan).
    *   **Considerations for battery choice**: Geometry, durability, capacity, and cost.
    *   **Environmental impact**: Used batteries, especially those with toxic materials, must be carefully discarded.
    *   **Primary (disposable) batteries**: Zinc carbon, zinc chloride, lithium iron disulfide, lithium-thionyl chloride, and mercury batteries.
*   **Fuel cells**: Potential future replacement for chemical cells, generating electric power by recombining hydrogen and oxygen. Caution is required due to the use of flammable materials like odorless hydrogen.
*   **Mechanical machine elements**: Store energy using devices like winding springs (common in radios and toys) and flywheels (for kinetic energy storage).
*   **Air pressure (Compressed gases/Pneumatics)**: Pneumatic cylinders are used in robots for moving arms, powered by rechargeable battery packs. They can deliver large forces suitable for larger components or grippers. Disadvantages include risks associated with improper handling of pressurized cylinders and pneumatic parts, which can damage metal parts upon failure.
*   **Hydraulics**: Essential for heavy-duty applications. Many industrial robots, particularly those for material handling, utilize hydraulic systems, providing precise movements. An example is a dual flexible arm robot based on an autonomous tractor, which includes an upgraded power system with a photovoltaic panel, a hydrogen fuel cell, and batteries.
*   **Supercapacitors (Ultracapacitors/Electro-chemical Double Layer Capacitors - EDLC)**: Offer advantages over batteries, including charging in seconds, effective operation in extreme temperatures, up to 60 times more power, and safety/reliability. They are suited for high-power, constant cycling settings like electric automobiles.
*   **Organic garbage**: Utilized by the Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot (EATR), which uses a biomass engine to convert organic material into biofuel to meet energy demands, aiming for long-range and endurance missions.

### 6. Robot Communication

**Robot communication** is defined as the robot's ability to receive input from its surroundings, process the data to make a decision, and execute required actions. This implies the robot is either autonomous or under human control. Communication involves an emitter producing a signal that is interpreted by a receiver, potentially with separation in space and/or time.

**Classification of Robot Communication**:
*   **Autonomous Robots**: Operate independently of human supervision. Their autonomy varies, ranging from preprogrammed logic for specific tasks (like industrial robots) to a high degree of autonomy incorporating sensors, feedback control, and advanced programming for learning new skills and adapting to environments. Control methods include fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, adaptive control, hierarchical control, and computational intelligence. Each autonomous robot has actuators and sensors managed by control units connected via a field bus. Communication with the external world (other robots, external services like navigation) occurs via wireless channels for mobile systems, using technologies like CAN-Bus and wireless LAN. Most modern robots are semi-autonomous, with humans making the majority of decisions.
*   **Controlled Robots**: Primarily rely on human input for decision-making.

**Robot Control Methods**:
*   **Wired Communication (Tethered)**: Involves physically connecting two robots or a robot and a controller via cabling. This method is historically common in industrial settings due to its reliability, near fail-proof nature, and high transmission speeds.
    *   **Simple wired control**: Handheld device switches or joysticks are directly connected to motors and electronics, simplifying management and complexity.
    *   **Drawback**: Control length is limited by the maximum length of the wire.
    *   **Advanced wired control**: A microprocessor onboard the robot receives signals from joysticks, switches, keypads, or computers to operate peripherals. Computer control can use serial I/O, parallel I/O, USB, or router devices, each with its protocol.

*   **Wireless Communication**: Allows information transfer from a controller to a robot without a physical link, with ranges from centimeters to millions of kilometers, primarily using radio waves.
    *   **Infrared (IR)**: Simple to implement and invisible. A microprocessor decodes IR light/pulses sent from a controller to the robot's IR receiver. Requires line-of-sight control and has a shorter range. Careful design is needed due to interference from sunlight or heat-generating objects. Used for inspection and measuring.
    *   **Radio Frequency (RF)**: Used in planes and cores. A transmitter sends electromagnetic waves at a specific frequency to a receiver, which then decodes the signal for microcontroller management. RF signals can travel further and penetrate most objects. Beginners may find sending and receiving data with RF modules challenging.
    *   **Wi-Fi Communication (IEEE 802.11)**: A current topic in robotics, allowing online robot operation. A wireless network adapter in a computer converts digital data to radio waves, and the robot's Wi-Fi unit converts it back. Wi-Fi modules offer faster data transfer rates, making them ideal for attaching cameras to robots.
    *   **Bluetooth**: An open wireless technology for short-distance data transfer (typically 8-10 meters). It enables device pairing and can transfer large volumes of data from various controllers (computers, smartphones) to a robot with a Bluetooth module. Bluetooth modules can communicate without a direct line of sight, making them viable for mobile robots.
    *   **Voice Control**: Requires a voice recognition module to convert voice commands into digital signals for the microcontroller. It is generally considered a less preferred option for beginners due to its limitations.
    *   **Global Positioning System (GPS)**: A satellite navigation system that provides location coordinates for objects with a GPS receiver. A robot's GPS receiver uses satellite signals to determine its precise location, speed, and direction. GPS is beneficial for outdoor robots, though its accuracy is limited to a few meters.

**Mobile Robots Operated by Smartphones** use voice commands or DTMF signals.

**Industrial Robotics Communication Protocols (Fieldbus)**:
*   A set of rules for device communication, which is extensive in industrial robots.
*   **Common Industrial Protocols (CIP)**: Overseen by the Open DeviceNet Vendors Association (ODVA), a standards development organization for open, interoperable industrial automation ICT. CIP combines control, communication, and routing features based on Ethernet networks and the Internet, with specific protocols varying by physical link, data link, and network layer.
    *   CIP Data: A producer, consumer, object-oriented, media-independent protocol with data, services, relationships, and behaviors. It has a robust object library for network services (e.g., file transfers) and traditional automation tasks (e.g., analog/digital I/O, HMI, motion control, position feedback).
*   **Ethernet IP**: Based on TCP/IP (IEEE 803.3) and leverages existing network technology. It uses the physical layer of Ethernet (44818 and 2222) and offers increased speeds (10 Mbps to 1 Gbps and beyond), enabling remote Internet and business control.
*   **Control-Net**: Utilizes RG-6 coaxial cables and a bus for a single media link, supporting 99 nodes, P2P connections, and 5 Mbps upload/download speeds.
*   **DeviceNet/ObjectNet**: Employs CAN-bus for physical and data connectivity levels.
    *   **CAN-bus**: Connects the host CPU controller and transceiver via two twisted pair connections, supporting speeds from 20 kbps (1,200 meters) to 1 Mbps (40 meters). DeviceNet can power devices, operate in master/slave mode, and support up to 64 nodes with limited consumption.

**Robot-to-Robot Communication**: Occurs between numerically controlled machines like robots, CNC machine tools, and 3D printers. In automated manufacturing, a supervisory controller (e.g., PLC) communicates with robot controllers and CNC machines via input/output signals. Data restoration between primary and backup robots can use cable communication and wireless connections.

**Remote Control Service Robots Communication System**: Based on Service IoT, Web, Wi-Fi, and ROS. These systems require quick and secure connections for stability and robustness, providing functional systems via the Internet and web-based technologies. A web-based Wi-Fi solution connects the operator's device to the robot controller via a Wi-Fi router, enabling remote control from distant locations and additional Internet-based functions.
*   **Microcontrollers**: Serve as the robot's "brain," making decisions, transmitting orders to motion systems, and receiving information from sensors and human interfaces (remote control).
*   **Robot-user interface**: Crucial for user adaptation. A web-enabled interface (smartphone, tablet, laptop, PC) can be hosted on the robot's computer, reducing hardware expenditure.
*   **Remote control design**: Requires in-depth understanding of robot equipment for data calculation, sending, reception, use, and display.
*   **Sensor information**: Provides data on images, sounds, temperature, and the robot's environment.
*   **Other components**: Include the foundation, motion systems (wheels, gears, motors, electronics), and actuators.
*   **Human communication system**: A proposed online remote control uses computer-generated voice and listens to commands via keyboard, joystick, voice, and web interface.
Industrial robots receive commands and communicate via wired modes for pick-and-place operations and semi-automatic modes for welding lines.

### 7. Internet of Things (IoT) in Robotics

The term **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to a network of physical objects linked to the Internet and other networks via individually identifiable IP addresses. These devices collect and transmit data using embedded sensors, electronics, and software, enabling real-time data sharing without human intervention.

**Common Elements of IoT**:
*   **Connectivity and Connectivity Levels**: Involves a network of things, devices, sensors, and objects. IoT connectivity protocols and standards come in fixed and wireless forms, spanning various distances: very near proximity (device-to-device), greater distances (device-to-cloud), and extremely long distances. Connectivity standards vary based on power requirements and data volume. The value of IoT begins with connected data and devices.

**Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)**: Includes heavy industries such as manufacturing, oil and gas, and transportation, as well as lighter applications like smart agriculture and smart cities. The Industrial Internet Consortium defines IIoT as machines, computers, and people using advanced data analysis for intelligent industrial operations to transform business outcomes.
*   IoT investments are primarily in the manufacturing sector, where large industrial IoT projects are completed.
*   IoT is a key component of global initiatives like Industry 4.0, which ushers in the fourth industrial revolution, and the Industrial Internet, aimed at transforming the industrial sector.
*   Numerous IoT application cases in manufacturing cover tasks such as digital connected factories, facility and asset management, safety and security, operations, logistics, and ecosystems.

**Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) concepts** incorporated in IoT include:
*   Asset management.
*   Intelligent manufacturing.
*   Performance optimization.
*   Monitoring and planning.
*   Human-machine interaction.
*   End-to-end operational visibility.

In **Industry 4.0**, cyber-physical systems and IoT are considered twin concepts. Industry 4.0 addresses production, asset management, and maintenance, including tracking and monitoring production assets. It effectively manages factors related to quality, performance, potential damage or breakdowns, and bottlenecks. Monitoring production flow increases efficiency, reduces waste, and minimizes work-in-process inventory. Remote equipment management involves defining precise criteria and restrictions to save costs and energy. Alerts for condition-based maintenance maximize machine availability, reduce downtime, and boost throughput. Aggregated data, including product and customer sentiment, drives quality monitoring and improvement.

The **Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT)** paradigm originates from IoT/IIoT. It refers to intelligent autonomous robotic objects within network infrastructures that possess capabilities such as sensing, actuation, processing, cognition, manipulation, motion communication, mobility, productivity, and autonomy. These objects work together or interact in a distributed manner to enable services and applications across various industrial domains. Future autonomous and linked IoRT systems must be able to sense, locate, think, connect, collaborate, learn, and act within the digital value chain. The architecture of an IoRT learning system emphasizes the distributed nature of services and learning models embedded in these "things".

**IoRT applications** integrate various types of devices and fields, including:
*   Robotic collaboration.
*   Automated guided vehicles (AGVs).
*   Lightweight mobile platforms.
*   Mobile robotic fleets in distribution centers and warehouses.
*   Production intralogistics.
*   Agribusinesses and specific environments.
*   General logistics.
*   Hospitals and stores.

### 8. Robotic Operating Systems (ROS)

Before ROS, significant effort was required to reimplement software infrastructure for complex robotics algorithms. Problems included inadequate standards, low code reuse, lack of device drivers and interfaces, reinvention of onboard operations control, interprocess communication protocols, and a lack of standard recording techniques.

**Robotic Operating System (ROS)** is an open-source meta-operating system for robots, built over a complete operating system like Ubuntu. It is a collection of software libraries and building blocks enabling the creation of robot applications on various robotic platforms. Developed by Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory starting in 2007, ROS provides features such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, common functionality implementation, message interaction between processes, and package management. ROS can be written in Lisp, C++, and Python.

**Main features of ROS**:
*   **Operating system side**: Provides standard operating system features including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, message passing between processes, and package management, along with functionality implementation.
*   **User-contributed packages**: A collection of packages implementing popular robot features such as planning, perception, manipulation, and vision.

**ROS Levels of Concepts**:
*   **File system level**: Disk-based resources like message types, service types, repositories, packages, and package manifests.
*   **Computation graph level**: A peer-to-peer network of ROS processes that collectively process data.
*   **Community level**: Facilitates sharing of software and expertise among community members through distribution repositories and ROS wiki.

**Philosophy of ROS**:
*   **Peer-to-peer**: ROS systems consist of numerous small program nodes that connect and communicate continuously.
*   **Tools-based**: Features numerous compact, generic applications for operations like visualization, logging, and graphing data streams.
*   **Multilingual**: ROS software modules can be written in various languages for client libraries, with existing libraries for C++, Python, Lisp, Java, JavaScript, Matlab, and Ruby.
*   **Community-based**: ROS protocols encourage developers to build independent libraries or packages wrapped to enable communication with other ROS modules, often hosted in free and open-source repositories.

**Physical components ROS can control** include robots, sensor drives, and motor controller drives.

**Elements in Robotic Operating System**:
*   **Nodes**: Single-use executable programs (e.g., sensor drivers, actuator drivers, map builders, planners, user interfaces) that can be individually compiled, executed, and managed. Nodes are written using ROS client libraries (roscpp for C++, rospy for Python) and can provide or use services or actions, and publish or subscribe to topics.
*   **Topics and Messages**:
    *   **Topic**: A stream of messages with a defined type (e.g., range finder data sent on a "scan" topic with a "laserscan" message type). Nodes communicate by exchanging messages on specific topics using a 1-to-N broadcast publish/subscribe model.
    *   **Messages**: Strictly typed data structures for inter-node communication.
*   **Services**: Implement a client-service model (1-to-1 request-response). Services carry out remote computation, trigger functions or behaviors, or retrieve data (e.g., a map server retrieves the current grid map for navigation).
*   **Master**: Provides connection information to nodes, allowing them to transmit messages to each other. When activated, every node connects to the master to register details of message streams they publish, services/actions they provide, and streams/services/actions they subscribe to. For example, a camera node publishing images to a topic and an image viewer node subscribing to it will be connected by the master.
*   **Parameter server**: A collection of values accessible via command prompts, nodes, or launch files. It is a shared, multivariate dictionary accessible through network APIs, used for static, non-binary data like configuration parameters rather than high-performance tasks. It also serves as a key-value store for training machine learning models on a cluster, where values represent model parameters. Nodes use this server to store and retrieve parameters at runtime.
*   **Bags (.bag extension)**: A file format in ROS for storing ROS message data. Bags subscribe to one or more ROS topics and store serialized message data in an efficient file structure as it is received. Bag files can be played back in ROS to the same topics they were recorded from or remapped to new topics. MatLab packages effectively use ROS bags.
*   **Supported platforms**: Ubuntu is currently fully supported, while Windows, Mac OS X, and Android are experimental. ROS Kinetic Kame runs on Ubuntu 16.4, with planned support for Ubuntu 15.10. ROS is fully integrated into the Linux environment, and the ROS bash package provides utility functions and tab completion.
*   **Packages**: Software in ROS is organized into packages, each containing one or more nodes, documentation, and a ROS interface. Most ROS packages are hosted on GitHub. A package can include ROS-independent libraries, datasets, configuration files, third-party software, or any useful module. Their goal is to provide functionality in an easy-to-consume manner for software reuse.

It integrates an Arduino UNO, L293D integrated circuits (16-pin twin H-bridge ICs that amplify low current signals to drive motors), two IR sensors (to detect black lines for path tracking), and ultrasonic sensors (to determine distance to objects). Arduino continuously monitors sensor data to control robot movement and arm operations.
*   **Obstacle avoidance robot**: Features a robot body with motors and wheels (two at the back, a free-rolling ball at the front) and a sensor (ultrasonic or infrared) positioned at the front to detect obstacles. Two additional sensors may be on the left and right sides. The microcontroller processes sensor signals to determine motor movement (left/right), enabling obstacle avoidance by analyzing data, making decisions, and transmitting corresponding signals to the motor drive.

An Arduino controls the robot using sensor signals. It includes a water tank for fire extinguishing. The robot moves randomly until fire is detected, then approaches the fire location, informs the user, stops at a safe distance, and extinguishes the fire with water.
    *   **Components**: Arduino Mega 2560, Adafruit motor shield, ultrasonic and flame sensors, HC-05 Bluetooth module, 9V DC water pump, push button, lithium-ion rechargeable battery, AA battery, 5V single channel relay module, and jumper wires.
    *   **Operation**: An advanced algorithm allows autonomous movement, stored on a computer acting as a master/server. Sensor readings are transmitted from the robot to the master for processing, which then sends commands back to the robot in a two-way, full-duplex mode. Bluetooth is used for communication between the microcontroller and transceiver. The Arduino IDE, a cross-platform application written in Java following C/C++ conventions, is used for programming. When the flame sensor is triggered, the robot sends a warning to the user's phone via Bluetooth, activating sound and vibration alerts. Upon sensing fire, the voltage drops, signaling the Arduino to activate the DC motor, guiding the robot to the fire and pumping water.

    *   **Connections**: The ESP32 microcontroller connects to the motor driver. The right IR sensor output connects to pin 15 of the ESP32, and the left IR sensor output to pin 13. The motor drive powers the wheel motors. The power bank provides power to the entire setup.
    *   **Coding (Arduino IDE)**: Involves defining variables for ESP32 pin numbers for motor signals and IR sensors, setting input/output modes in `void setup`, and declaring sensor conditions in `void loop` to guide wheel movements (forward, turning right/left, stop) based on sensor input.
    *   **Principle**: Two IR sensors emit radiation. If radiation falls on a black surface, it is absorbed, causing wheel deviation and subsequent realignment. This continuous alternative detection on white and black surfaces enables the robot to follow the line. The prototype demonstrates automated movement and decision-making for material and product transport in industrial sectors.
