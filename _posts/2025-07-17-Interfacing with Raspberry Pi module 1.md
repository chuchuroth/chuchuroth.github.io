Here is a comprehensive summary of the technical information from the sources, with colloquial language removed:

### Raspberry Pi Network Connectivity

*   **Wired Connection:** The Raspberry Pi can connect to a network via a wired Ethernet connection using its built-in RJ45 connector.
*   **Wireless Connection:** It can also connect wirelessly using its integrated WiFi adapter. The process involves powering up the Raspberry Pi, starting the WiFi configuration from the desktop (accessible via an icon in pull-down menus or a console window), selecting a network, and providing a password if required.
*   **IP Address Assignment:** Upon connecting to a network, the Raspberry Pi obtains an IP address dynamically using **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**. This process is built-in and requires no user intervention.

### Web Browsing

*   A web browser, **Chromium**, is pre-installed on the Raspberry Pi.

### Firewalls

*   **Function:** Firewalls can block communication by restricting access to specific **ports**.
*   **Ports:** These are unique identifiers for applications on a machine, with approximately 16,000 available ports.
*   **Common Port Usage:**
    *   **Port 80** is typically used for web traffic (web browsers and web servers) and is generally unblocked.
    *   Other applications, such as Secure Shell (SSH), use different ports (e.g., **Port 22** for SSH).
    *   **Port 53** is associated with DNS (Domain Name System).
*   **Firewall Impact:** If an application's required port is blocked, communication will fail.
*   **Resolution:** To enable communication, firewalls must be configured to allow traffic on the necessary ports, either by the user or a network administrator.
*   **Temporary Workaround:** Creating a WiFi hotspot with a personal device, such as a cellphone, might circumvent firewall restrictions, though this can be less secure.
*   Port numbers are 16-bit values within TCP or UDP headers. Low port numbers (1023 and below) are often dedicated to specific applications.

### Secure Shell (SSH)

*   **Definition:** SSH is a program that enables **remote access to a machine**, providing a secure shell.
*   **Shell Functionality:** A shell is a program that accepts and interprets commands (e.g., `ls` for directory listings, `cd` for changing directories) and displays the results. LXTerminal on Raspberry Pi runs a shell.
*   **Remote Shell Operation:** With SSH, commands typed on a local machine (client) are sent to a remote machine (server) for execution, and the results are returned to the client's screen.
*   **Primary Use Case:** SSH is particularly useful for controlling a Raspberry Pi remotely without connecting a physical screen, keyboard, or mouse (known as "headless" operation).
*   **Security:** SSH ensures **secure communication by encrypting traffic in transit**. Its predecessor, Telnet, is not secure as it lacks encryption.
*   **Client-Server Model:** SSH adheres to a client-server architecture.
    *   **SSH Server:** This program runs on the machine intended for remote access (e.g., the Raspberry Pi).
    *   **SSH Client:** This program runs on the machine used to initiate the remote connection (e.g., a laptop).
    *   The client sends commands to the server, which executes them and sends responses back to the client.
*   **Interface:** Standard SSH connections use a **text-based terminal interface** (no graphical user interface or GUI), which conserves network bandwidth.
*   **SSH Requirements:**
    *   Both the client and server machines must be connected to the internet and have unique IP addresses.
    *   An SSH client program must be running on the client machine. This is typically built into Linux and macOS, but Windows users may need to download a client like PuTTY.
    *   An SSH server program must be installed and actively running on the machine being controlled. On Raspberry Pi (Raspbian), the SSH server (SSHD daemon) runs by default upon boot. Other Linux systems may require manual configuration to start the server at boot time, and Windows machines need a dedicated SSH server download and setup.
    *   The server machine requires a valid user account with credentials (username and password) for authentication.
    *   Any firewalls present must be configured to permit SSH traffic, typically on Port 22.
*   **Enabling SSH on Raspberry Pi:** If not already enabled, SSH can be activated via the Raspberry Pi Configuration settings (under Preferences, then Interfaces tab, by selecting "Enabled" next to SSH). It is crucial to **change the default Raspberry Pi password** before enabling SSH to prevent security vulnerabilities.
*   **Executing an SSH Connection (Linux/Mac):**
    *   Open a terminal and use the command `ssh [username]@[domain_name_or_IP_address]`.
    *   The `username` must be a valid account on the server machine, and the address can be either a domain name or an IP address.
    *   **First-Time Connection:** The client will prompt that the host's authenticity cannot be established and ask for confirmation. Typing `yes` will proceed and store the host's address for future connections.
    *   A password prompt will follow, where the password is typed invisibly.
    *   Upon successful authentication, a command-line prompt appears, allowing remote command execution.
*   **Host ID Keys:** Raspberry Pi devices come with default private host ID keys that are identical across all installations, posing a security risk. It is recommended to execute a specific command before the first SSH connection to generate a new, unique set of keys.

### IP Addresses and Domain Names

*   **IP Address:** A **unique numerical address** assigned to every machine connected to the internet. It is essential for sending messages between hosts and is included in the IP header of network packets.
    *   **IPv4:** The widely used older version, utilizing 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.0.0.0). These addresses are divided into a network address (high bytes, common to a local area network) and a host address (low bytes, unique to individual machines). Due to its 2^32 address limit, which the internet has surpassed, techniques like Network Address Translation (NAT) are used.
    *   **IPv6:** A newer version that uses 128-bit addresses to support a significantly larger number of unique hosts. It also includes integrated security features like IPSec for data encryption.
*   **Domain Name:** A **human-readable pseudonym** for an IP address (e.g., `cnn.com`). These are used because IP addresses are difficult for humans to memorize.
*   **Domain Naming System (DNS):** A hierarchical system that **translates domain names into IP addresses**.
    *   When a domain name is accessed, a **DNS lookup** occurs, where the client sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into its corresponding IP address.
    *   DNS lookups are often cached locally for improved performance.
    *   The `nslookup` command can be used on Linux to manually perform a DNS lookup, showing the DNS server's IP address and port (Port 53).
*   **Dynamic vs. Static IP Addresses:**
    *   **Dynamic IP addresses** are assigned via DHCP and can change with each network connection. Raspberry Pi devices typically receive dynamic IP addresses on open networks.
    *   **Static IP addresses** are fixed and do not change, often requiring a paid service from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) for home use. Raspberry Pi usually lacks a static IP address or a fixed domain name.
*   **Determining Raspberry Pi's IP Address:** To find the Raspberry Pi's current IP address, a keyboard and screen must be connected initially. The `ifconfig` command can be executed in the terminal. The IP address for wireless connections is displayed under `wlan0` next to `inet addr`.

### Internet Protocols and Network Structure

*   **Programmatic Networking:** Refers to interacting with a network using code or programs, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) devices to communicate with servers, retrieve data, and request services.
*   **IoT Functionality:** IoT devices like the Raspberry Pi interface with the physical world through sensors (for data input) and actuators (for physical output), exchanging data with remote internet servers to perform complex tasks.
*   **Internet Structure:** The internet is an **ad hoc, decentralized network** composed of interconnected local area networks (LANs). These LANs are linked by a hierarchy of networking infrastructure such as routers, switches, and bridges.
*   **Protocols:** Protocols are **sets of rules that govern communication** on the internet, defining how data is transferred and the structure of messages (e.g., headers, payloads).
    *   **Header:** Contains protocol-specific information necessary for message delivery, such as destination address and message size.
    *   **Payload:** The actual data being transmitted.
    *   To communicate across different networks, machines must adhere to these internet protocols, encapsulating their data according to the protocol's specifications.
*   **Key Internet Protocols:**
    *   **IP (Internet Protocol):**
        *   Defines the naming scheme (IP addresses) for hosts.
        *   Manages **host-to-host (machine-to-machine) communication**.
        *   Is inherently **unreliable**, meaning there is no guarantee that a sent message will arrive at its destination.
    *   **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
        *   Operates on top of IP.
        *   Facilitates **process-to-process communication** using port numbers to identify applications.
        *   Is also **unreliable** and **connectionless**, meaning it does not guarantee packet arrival or maintain packet sequencing.
        *   Is simpler and faster than TCP due to fewer overheads.
    *   **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
        *   Operates on top of IP.
        *   Also provides **process-to-process communication** using port numbers.
        *   Is **reliable** and **connection-oriented**, guaranteeing message delivery through retries and acknowledgments.
        *   Supports **packet sequencing** to ensure data arrives in the correct order.
        *   Handles flow control and error detection/correction.
        *   Is more complex than UDP but offers stronger guarantees for data delivery.
    *   **Protocol Combination:** IP must be used in conjunction with either TCP or UDP for internet communication. TCP and UDP are classified as **transport layer protocols**.

### Client-Server Model and Sockets

*   **Client-Server Model:** This model describes a prevalent form of interaction over the internet.
    *   A **server process** (on one machine) manages a resource, listens for requests, and sends responses.
    *   A **client process** (on another machine) makes requests to the server.
    *   Examples include web servers, print servers, and SSH servers.
*   **Socket:** An **endpoint of a connection** between a client and a server.
    *   Each connection involves two sockets, one on the client side and one on the server side.
    *   In programming, sockets are used to establish, open, and close network connections.
    *   A socket is uniquely identified by the combination of an **IP address** (of the host machine) and a **port number** (of the specific application/process).
*   **Ports and Servers:**
    *   Multiple client and server processes can run concurrently on a single machine.
    *   Server processes specifically listen for and receive traffic directed to their assigned port numbers.
    *   Client processes direct their requests to the server's IP address at the specific port associated with the intended application (e.g., a web client targets port 80 for web traffic, an SSH client targets port 22 for SSH traffic).
