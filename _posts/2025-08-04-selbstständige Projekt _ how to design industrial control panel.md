The document, based on the YouTube video "How to Test PLC Digital Inputs and Outputs (Step-by-Step Guide)" from the RealPars channel, provides a guide for troubleshooting PLC digital inputs and outputs in a process control environment, focusing on interpreting LED status indicators and using a digital multimeter (DMM). Below is a concise extraction of the key information:

### Common Causes of Failures
- **Field Devices**: Sensors and actuators account for ~75% of failures.
- **PLC I/O Modules**: Responsible for ~25% of failures.
- **PLC Programs**: Rarely cause failures; assumed error-free in the video, but programs can aid troubleshooting.

### Digital vs. Analog I/O
- **Digital Signals**: Binary (voltage on/off).
  - Inputs represent physical devices (e.g., proximity sensors, push buttons).
  - Outputs control devices (e.g., relays, lamps).
- **Analog Signals**: Continuous (e.g., 1-5V, 4-20mA) for process variables (e.g., pressure, temperature) or control devices (e.g., valves, dampers).

### Essential Troubleshooting Tools and Practices
- **Wiring Drawings**: Up-to-date drawings are critical.
- **PLC Ladder Logic**: Symbols may not match physical devices, as they are chosen based on logic requirements.
- **LED Indicators**: Show input/output status (on/off or voltage supply) on PLC modules.
- **DMM Usage**: Measure with a specific expectation to avoid confusion; each measurement guides the next.

### Troubleshooting a Digital Input Circuit (Example: Normally Closed Push Button)
- **Normal Operation**:
  - LED (e.g., LED1) on, logic symbol true: DMM measures +24V DC at the module terminal.
- **Fault Condition** (LED off, logic false when it should be true):
  1. **Measure at PLC Input Module Terminal**:
     - 24V DC: Faulty module likely.
     - 0V DC: Suspect defective switch, power supply, or broken wire.
  2. **Measure at Switch’s Module Side**:
     - 24V DC: Likely broken wire between switch and module.
     - 0V DC: Suspect defective switch or power supply.
  3. **Measure at Power Supply Side of Switch**:
     - 24V DC: Power supply is fine; switch likely defective (ohmmeter test optional).

### Troubleshooting a Digital Output Circuit (Example: Lamp with Sourcing Module)
- **Normal Operation**:
  - LED (e.g., LED0) and lamp on when the lamp coil symbol is true.
- **Fault Condition** (LED on, lamp off when it should be on):
  1. **Measure Between Fuse and Lamp**:
     - 0V: Likely open fuse.
     - 24V DC: Suspect defective lamp, broken wire, or corroded ground.
  2. **Measure at Lamp’s Ground Side**:
     - 24V DC: Lamp is fine; fault is a broken wire to ground or corroded ground connection.
     - 0V DC: Defective lamp.

### Additional Resources
- Recommended course: "PLC Hardware Fundamentals: Power, I/O Modules, and Signals" for learning about PLC I/O modules, operation, current direction, and sinking/sourcing concepts.
- Specialized courses available for industrial automation technicians and engineers.

This information provides a structured approach to diagnosing and resolving issues with PLC digital inputs and outputs using LED indicators and systematic DMM measurements.

Lean manufacturing focuses on eliminating waste by producing only enough products to meet customer demand, avoiding finished goods inventory.

**Pull-Based System**:
- Demand-driven, not forecast-based.
- Limits work in process (WIP) by producing only to fulfill actual customer orders.
- Uses signals to indicate production needs.
- Applicable to production floors or information flow between departments.

**Types of Pull Systems**:
1. **Sequential Pull**:
   - Downstream personnel pull parts from upstream in production sequence.
   - Aims for one-piece flow or small batches to minimize WIP inventory.
2. **Replenishment Pull (Supermarket System)**:
   - Downstream personnel pull parts from a storage location.
   - Supplying process replenishes removed parts.

**Kanban**:
- Uses signals (e.g., cards) to communicate supply needs in pull systems.

**Information Flow**:
- Employees pull tasks based on capacity, prioritizing work and preventing overload.

**Examples**:
- A single sub-assembly footprint between workstations signals replenishment when removed, limiting WIP.
- A consumed box of components triggers a signal (e.g., card, light) for material handling to deliver another box when WIP limits (e.g., half a box) are reached.
