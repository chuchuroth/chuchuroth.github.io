#### Fundamental Principle of Gripper Operation:
*   Compressed air forces a piston up and down, opening and closing jaws through a mechanical linkage.
*   Jaw movements: Parallel, angular, and toggle.
*   **Friction** secures the object. Friction coefficient is affected by surface type (metal on metal, elastomers on metal, smooth/rough, glass/fragile) and surface holding force. Polyurethane pads are used to increase friction and reduce workpiece damage.

        *   **Internal gripper**: Holds objects from the middle by force that opens the gripper, necessary for certain object shapes.
    *   Gripping mechanisms: Linkage actuation (swinging/rotating for cylindrical objects, linear movement using pneumatic piston cylinders with slider crank mechanisms), gear and rack actuation, cam and follower actuation (spring-loaded, accommodates different sized objects), lead screw actuation (motor and speed reduction moves threaded block), rope and pulley grippers (motor attached to pulley actuates gripper).
    *   Applications: Palletizing, part selection and transfer, machine loading.

Vacuum cups maintain hold during power outages.

*   **Adhesive Gripper**: Uses adhesive substances (glues, bonding agents) to grasp workpiece. Repeated use reduces tackiness, solved by continuous adhesive ribbon feeding.
    *   **Advantages**: Handles fabrics and lightweight materials, lifts heavy objects, requires one contact surface.
*   **Bladder Gripper**: Expandable doughnut-shaped or cylindrical inflatable sleeve for cylinder/rod-shaped objects. Enlarges to tighten around component; force sensors detect and adjust pressure. Bladder shrinks as pressure decreases to release.

*   **Conventional Set vs. Fuzzy Set**:
    *   **Conventional set**: Has a crisp, clear outline (e.g., ripe mango is either in or out of the set). Characteristic function returns 0 or 1.
    *   **Fuzzy set**: Contours are fuzzy or gradual, not crisp. Allows for transition stages (e.g., a mango becoming ripe).
*   **Fuzzy Number**: Generalization of a real number; refers to a connected set of possible values, each with a weight (membership function) between 0 and 1.
*   **Fuzzification**: Process of converting a real value to a fuzzy one to regulate the degree of membership.
*   **Membership Function**: Defines the degree of membership (value between 0 and 1) for each value in a fuzzy set. Differs from a characteristic function by taking any value between 0 and 1.
*   **Fuzzy Logic Operators**: Used to construct logical arguments with fuzzy concepts, calculating degrees of truth.
    *   **AND (Intersection)**: Degree of truth is the **minimum** of the individual truths (e.g., `min(Mu_A, Mu_B)`).
    *   **OR (Union)**: Degree of truth is the **maximum** of the individual truths (e.g., `max(Mu_A, Mu_B)`).
    *   **NOT (Complement)**: Degree of truth is `1 - Mu_A`.

*   **Artificial Intelligence and Fuzzy Reasoning**: Fuzzy rule base formalizes and applies human thinking, acting as a primary tool in fuzzy logic applications. Rules typically used independently, but can be combined (e.g., "if high pressure and average temperature then low output").
