## üí° What is n8n?

**n8n (pronounced "n-eight-n")** is an open-source, low-code automation tool. You can think of it as a **self-hostable Zapier or Make.com**, allowing you to connect and automate between apps (like Shopify, Stripe, Gmail, Airtable, Notion, CRMs, etc.) and build smart workflows.

When someone fills out a form on your website (e.g., ‚ÄúRequest Demo‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet a Quote‚Äù):

* n8n grabs the form data (via Webhook, Typeform, Tally, etc.)
* Automatically creates a new contact in your **CRM** (HubSpot, Zoho, Notion, Airtable, etc.)
* Sends an **intro email** or assigns a sales task

‚û°Ô∏è *Keeps your sales pipeline updated without manual data entry.*
