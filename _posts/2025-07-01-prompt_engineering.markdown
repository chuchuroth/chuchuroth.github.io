Absolutely — **prompt engineering** is one of the most important skills in the AI era. It's essentially the art and science of crafting **effective instructions (prompts)** to get the best results from AI systems like ChatGPT, image generators, and autonomous agents.

---

## 🔧 What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is:

> The practice of designing inputs (text prompts) to guide an AI system toward producing desired outputs, reliably and accurately.

It’s like **programming with language** — instead of writing code, you write instructions that "steer" the model.

---

## 🔥 Key Skills in Prompt Engineering

1. **Clarity** – Be specific and unambiguous.
2. **Context** – Give background and structure.
3. **Role Assignment** – Tell the AI *who* it is (e.g., "Act as a UX designer...").
4. **Step-by-Step Thinking** – Ask for explanations or plans in stages.
5. **Constraints** – Set boundaries (e.g., word count, tone, format).
6. **Iteration** – Adjust and refine your prompts.

## 🧠 Popular Prompt Structures

Here are commonly used **formulas** and **keywords**:

### 1. **Role-Based Prompts**

> “You are a **\[role]**. Your task is to…”

Examples:

* “You are a professional editor. Improve the clarity and tone of this paragraph.”
* “Act as a career coach. What are some jobs for someone with a biology background?”

### 2. **Few-Shot Learning**

> Provide **examples** before asking for an answer.

Example:

```
Translate the following to French:
1. Hello – Bonjour
2. Thank you – Merci
3. Good night – ?
```

### 3. **Chain-of-Thought Prompts**

> “Think step-by-step” or “First, do X, then do Y.”

Examples:

* “Explain this in three stages: definition, example, conclusion.”
* “Think step-by-step and solve the math problem.”

### 4. **Formatting + Output Control**

> “Respond in **JSON**, in **bullet points**, as a **table**,” etc.

Examples:

* “Summarize the article in bullet points.”
* “Give me the output as a Markdown table.”
