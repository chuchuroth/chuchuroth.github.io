Here is the knowledgical information extracted from the sources, with colloquial language removed:

### Raspberry Pi and Network Communication

The **Raspberry Pi** can be networked and used for communication over a network. It serves as a device capable of interacting with **web-based services**. Due to its limited computational capacity and information storage, the Raspberry Pi often acts as a front-end device, sending requests to external servers for more elaborate processing or data retrieval. This enables **Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities**, such as remotely controlling physical devices.

### Sockets Library (Low-Level Communication)

The **socket interface** is a fundamental method for programmatic communication over the Internet. While useful, it is a **low-level library** that requires the programmer to handle a significant amount of detail.

*   **Programmer Burden**: When using the socket library, the programmer must explicitly **compose the message content**. This involves knowing the specific format and rules of the network protocol being used, such as HTTP. For example, the programmer needs to specify the method (e.g., `GET`), headers, and the correct termination sequence (`\r\n\r\n`) for HTTP requests.
*   **Ad-hoc Communication**: The socket library is suitable for **ad-hoc communication** where a custom, simple protocol can be defined between devices (e.g., two Raspberry Pis sending a fixed number of bytes). In such cases, there is no need to adhere to complex, pre-defined protocols.
*   **Example: HTTP GET Request**: Connecting to a web server (e.g., `Google.com` on Port 80) requires:
    *   Performing a **DNS lookup** (e.g., `socket.gethostbyname()`) to obtain the IP address.
    *   Composing the HTTP GET message string, including the method, path (`/`), HTTP version (`HTTP/1.1`), and carriage return/line feed characters (`\r\n\r\n`) to signify the end of the message.
    *   Sending this composed message as a byte array.
*   **Challenges**: For more complex protocols, composing messages with the socket library becomes tedious and requires detailed knowledge of the protocol specifications.

### High-Level Networking Libraries and Web-Based Services

To simplify network communication, **protocol-specific libraries** are available.

*   **Benefits of High-Level Libraries**:
    *   The programmer **does not need to know the protocol details**.
    *   They handle low-level details such as character return line feeds and message formatting.
    *   They provide **functions where arguments are key information** rather than raw message bytes.
    *   They parse incoming raw messages, extracting only the relevant "payload" data for the programmer.
*   **Examples of Libraries**: `http.client` (for HTTP) and `smtplib` (for SMTP email) are examples of such libraries in Python.
*   **Online Services**: These are services run on **remote servers** (in the cloud) that are accessible over the network.
    *   **Purpose**: They perform tasks that a Raspberry Pi might not have the capacity for, such as computationally intensive operations or accessing large datasets.
    *   **Interaction**: A client device, like a Raspberry Pi, sends a **request message** to the service's servers, and the servers send back a **response message** with the results.
    *   **Common Protocols**: These web-based services typically interact using **HTTP messages**.
    *   **Examples of Public Services**: Google Maps, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook all provide online services that devices can interact with programmatically.
    *   **Cost**: Some services may have a cost, though many offer a free tier with limited functionality.

### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs)

*   **API (Application Programming Interface)**:
    *   An **API defines a communication interface between programs**.
    *   For web-based services, an API specifies the **format of messages** that exchange between client and server. This includes:
        *   Required headers and their content.
        *   The structure of the payload.
        *   **Legal sequences of messages** if the protocol is not stateless.
    *   The API dictates how to compose an HTTP message to achieve a desired service.
    *   **Example (Google Maps Mockup)**: An API might specify that to get a map of a place, an HTTP GET message must include `/maps/` followed by the place name.
*   **SDK (Software Development Kit)**:
    *   An **SDK is a set of tools that support the use of an API**.
    *   Typically, an SDK consists of **library functions** that adhere to the API's specifications.
    *   **Benefits of SDKs**: They abstract the details of the API, allowing the programmer to call simple functions (e.g., `get_map("UCI")`) instead of manually composing complex messages. The SDK handles the creation of the proper request message and its transmission.
*   **Relationship**: While an API defines the interface, an SDK provides the practical tools to use that interface. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but the API is the specification, and the SDK is the implementation aid.

### Sentiment Analysis Example (AlchemyAPI by IBM)

*   **Functionality**: **Sentiment analysis** analyzes text to determine if it carries a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
*   **Rationale for External Service**: This task is **computationally complex**, requires significant learned data (often using machine learning), and fast techniques are typically proprietary. Therefore, it's inefficient or impossible for a Raspberry Pi to perform it locally.
*   **API/SDK Use**: Companies like IBM (owner of AlchemyAPI) provide an **API** that allows users to send text or webpage links to their servers for analysis. Users can download an **SDK** (e.g., AlchemyAPI's SDK) that provides functions to access this service without needing to know the API's message format details.
*   **Process Example**:
    1.  Import the `AlchemyAPI` class.
    2.  Call a method like `AlchemyAPI.sentiment()`, passing the data type (e.g., `HTML`) and the text/HTML string to be analyzed.
    3.  The SDK composes and sends the message, the server processes it, and returns a response, often including a sentiment score (e.g., from -1 to +1).
*   **Authentication**: Access to such APIs usually requires **registration and an API key** to track usage and enforce limits. Many offer a limited number of free requests per day.
*   **Raspberry Pi Compatibility**: While the concept is general, the specific AlchemyAPI SDK's direct installation on a Raspberry Pi is not guaranteed by the source.

### Twitter API Interaction (Twython SDK)

The Raspberry Pi can interact with the **Twitter API** to both send and receive (filter) tweets.

*   **Twython SDK**: **Twython** is a Python package and SDK specifically used to access Twitter's API.
*   **Installation of Twython**:
    1.  Perform a system update: `sudo apt-get update`.
    2.  Install `pip` (Python package installer): `sudo apt-get install python-pip`.
    3.  Install Twython using pip: `pip install Twython`. (Note: This process can take several minutes).
*   **Authentication Keys**: To interact with Twitter's API, an application must be registered, and **four authentication keys** are required:
    *   Consumer Key
    *   Consumer Secret
    *   Access Token
    *   Access Token Secret
    These keys are hard-coded into the application's code and used by the Twython SDK to authenticate with Twitter servers.
*   **App Registration Process to Obtain Keys**:
    1.  Obtain a **Twitter account**.
    2.  Navigate to `http://apps.twitter.com`.
    3.  Click "Create New App".
    4.  Fill in required fields: **Name, Description, Website** (any website is acceptable for testing).
    5.  Set permissions to "read-write" (usually default).
    6.  The initial page displays the **Consumer Key**.
    7.  Go to the "Keys and Access Tokens" tab to find the **Consumer Secret** and generate the **Access Token** and **Access Token Secret**.
    8.  **Record all four keys** for future use.
*   **Sending a Tweet (Updating Status)**:
    1.  Import the `Twython` class: `from twython import Twython`.
    2.  Define the four authentication keys as variables. (For security during demonstration, these might be loaded from a separate file).
    3.  Create a `Twython` object (API object) by calling its constructor with the four keys: `api = Twython(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)`. This establishes the authenticated connection.
    4.  Call the `update_status` method on the API object, passing the tweet text as an argument: `api.update_status(status='Your tweet text')`. This sends the tweet to Twitter.
*   **Receiving and Filtering Tweets**:
    *   The Raspberry Pi can monitor public Twitter streams for specific strings or hashtags.
    *   This requires the **`TwythonStreamer` class**.
    *   **Custom Class for Stream Handling**:
        1.  Define a new Python class (e.g., `MyStreamer`) that **extends (subclasses) `TwythonStreamer`**. This inherits `TwythonStreamer`'s methods and attributes.
        2.  **Redefine the `on_success()` method** within the custom class.
            *   `on_success()` is a **callback function**. It is automatically invoked by the `TwythonStreamer` when a tweet matching the filter criteria is successfully found in the stream.
            *   The `on_success()` method typically takes `self` and `data` as arguments. The `data` argument is a **dictionary** containing all information about the matching tweet, including its `text` content.
            *   The programmer defines what action `on_success()` performs (e.g., print a message, blink an LED).
        3.  Instantiate the custom streamer class, passing the four authentication keys: `stream = MyStreamer(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)`.
        4.  Call the `statuses.filter()` method on the stream object, specifying the string or hashtag to track: `stream.statuses.filter(track='your_string_or_hashtag')`. This initiates continuous monitoring of the public stream.
    *   **Responding to Tweets (IoT Example)**: Instead of just printing "Found it," the `on_success()` callback can be modified to perform physical actions. For instance, a `blink()` function could be called within `on_success()` to **turn an LED on and off via Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins** (e.g., pin 13) in response to a matching tweet.

### Demonstration Environment

*   **Remote Access**: A **Secure Shell (SSH) client** like **PuTTY** is used to connect to and control the Raspberry Pi's terminal remotely from a desktop machine.
*   **Python Execution**: Python code can be executed directly in the command line (interactive mode) or as a script.
*   **Security for Keys**: During demonstrations, authentication keys are often loaded from a separate file using `execfile()` to prevent their direct display.
