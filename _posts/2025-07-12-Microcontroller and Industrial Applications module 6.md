The provided sources contain comprehensive information on the development and principles of several robotic systems using ESP32 microcontrollers. The knowledge can be extracted as follows:

### I. Line Follower Robot (LFR)

*   **Motivation and Purpose**
    *   A Line Follower Robot (LFR) is designed to **autonomously follow a path marked by a line of contrasting color** on a surface.
    *   In industrial settings, LFRs are introduced to **transport products or materials** from one location to another, thereby **reducing cost, increasing efficiency, and saving time and resources** compared to manual labor.
    *   The objective is to develop an LFR capable of **handling various environmental conditions and line configurations**, accurately following a designed path, and making real-time adjustments as needed.

*   **Working Principle**
    *   LFRs generally utilize **two IR (infrared) sensors** to track the line.
    *   IR sensors **radiate infrared light towards the line**.
    *   Lines are typically marked with absorbable colors (e.g., black) and non-absorbable colors (e.g., white).
    *   When the IR radiation strikes a **white surface**, the sensor **receives a return signal**, which is used to guide the vehicle's movement.
    *   When both sensors strike a **complete black line**, the black surface absorbs the IR radiation, and the **vehicle stops**.
    *   The robot continuously **interprets signals from the sensors and makes decisions** to realign its movement, ensuring it follows the black line and stops when a horizontal black line is detected.

*   **Major Components**
    *   **Sensor:** Two IR sensors are used to collect real-time data.
    *   **Microcontroller:** ESP32 microcontroller processes the data and sends commands.
    *   **Motor Driver:** Used to activate and connect to the DC motors. It amplifies the voltage signal from the microcontroller to provide higher power for the motors.
    *   **Motor:** DC motors facilitate movement.
    *   **Power Supply:** A 9-volt battery or power bank (with a C type connector) powers the entire setup.
    *   **Robot Structure:** Includes two wheels for movement and a rolling wheel at the bottom.
    *   Jumper wires are used for connections.

    *   **Input/Output Mode Setting:** The `void setup` function configures the input and output modes for the defined pin ports.
    *   **Conditional Movement:** The `void loop` function continuously checks sensor inputs and guides the robot's movement:
        *   If **both sensors detect white**, a command is sent to the microcontroller to **move forward**.
        *   If the **right sensor detects white**, a command is sent to the microcontroller to **turn right**.
        *   If the **left sensor detects white**, a command is sent to the microcontroller to **turn left**.
        *   If **both sensors detect black**, a command is sent to the microcontroller to **stop the motor**.
    *   Output signal conditions for forward, right turn, stopping, and left turn are defined within specific code loops.

    *   The technology **reduces the need for human manpower** in industries where tasks can be automated.
    *   It is an **essential mechanism in autonomous vehicles to prevent accidents and collisions**.
    *   The prototype aims to develop an autonomous robot capable of **detecting obstacles in front of it and adjusting its movement accordingly**. If no obstacle is detected, the robot continues its current direction.

    *   **Distance Reading:** The system continuously reads the distance to an obstacle.
    *   **Conditional Movement (defined in `void loop`):**
        *   If the **distance to an obstacle is less than or equal to 20 centimeters**: The robot **stops movement**, moves backward, and then stops again.
        *   If the **distance is greater than 20 centimeters**: The robot **moves forward** and continues to read the distance.
    *   **Direction Adjustment:**
        *   The system locks the right side and calculates the distance, then locks the left side and calculates the distance.
        *   If the **right distance is greater than or equal to the left distance, the robot turns right**.
        *   Otherwise, the robot stops movement, turns left, stops movement, and then moves forward.
    *   Separate functions (`void move_stop`, `void move_forward`, `void move_backward`, `void turn_right`, `void turn_left`) define specific conditions for robot actions.
