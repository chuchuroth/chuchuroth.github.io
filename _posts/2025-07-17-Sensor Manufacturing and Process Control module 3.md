### Sensor Technology Overview

Module three focuses on embedding sensors and motors, specifically reviewing sensors found in advanced technologies such as **radar level transmitters, lidar, and various medical sensors**.

### Medical Sensors

*   **Heart Rate Monitors**: These medical sensors are exemplified by devices found on stair climbing machines in gyms. They operate by **registering small electrical signals across the surface of the skin** each time the heart contracts.
*   **Pressure Sensors**:
    *   Used in diverse medical equipment, including **anesthesia delivery machines, oxygen concentrators, blood analyzers, dialysis machines, and respirators**.
    *   **Disposable blood pressure sensors** are employed in surgical procedures and intensive care units for continuous monitoring. These sensors utilize plastic molded tubing, connectors, and ergonomic cable assemblies.
    *   In **oxygen concentrators**, **differential pressure sensors** measure flow rate, capable of recording pressures as low as 4 kilopascals.
    *   For **endo-vascular surgery** to repair abdominal aortic aneurysms, a **pressure wire** serves as a delicate pressure and temperature transmitter. It measures blood pressure and temperature in the aorta and transmits data wirelessly to operating room instrumentation. **False readings must be avoided** by ensuring the sensor element is not in a sharp bend or in contact with arterial walls.
    *   **Digital pressure sensors** can be designed to fit into a hypodermic tube with an outside diameter under one millimeter, allowing placement inside a blood vessel. They can measure **gauge pressure as high as 300 millimeters of mercury (mmHg)**, sufficient for blood pressure monitoring (normal is 120/80 mmHg). These sensors are extremely small, measuring **750 microns by 220 microns by 75 microns**. The pressure output is a digital count, convertible to pressure using a specified transfer function.
*   **Temperature Sensors**:
    *   Applications include **neonatal intensive care units, oral and rectal digital thermometers, and organ transplant monitoring**.
    *   These sensors are typically **small, rugged, and overlaid with soft plastics** to protect internal organs from damage upon contact.
    *   **Semiconductor sensors** are frequently used due to their **ultra-small size and ease of circuit interface with microcircuits**.
    *   An example is the **LMT 70 from Texas Instruments**, which has an accuracy of **±0.15°C at 25°C** and a package size of **0.9 millimeter square**. Its sensing element consists of stacked base-emitter junctions biased by a current source. The output connects to a precision amplifier and then an output switch, allowing for multiplexing of many sensors.
    *   **Implantable temperature sensors** require minimal associated circuitry.
    *   The **TMP 117M sensor**, a semiconductor thermal sensor, is designed to be attached to a patient's skin via a flexible printed circuit board, thermally isolated from other heat sources. It draws only **3.5 microamps to prevent self-heating** and meets the ASTME 11122 specification for medical thermal sensors. It features a **16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ATC), an I2C compatible serial interface, and a 48-bit EEPROM**.
    *   Calibration for temperature sensors can be a **single-point calibration** (e.g., relative to 0°C) to adjust for an offset, or a **two-point calibration** (e.g., at 0°C and 100°C) for higher accuracy, adjusting both offset and slope.
*   **Flow Sensors**:
    *   Used in surgical and intensive care equipment, including **anesthesia delivery, oxygen concentrators, ventilators, and respirators**.
    *   **Ultra-low flow sensors** are utilized in continuous drug delivery systems and new patient lab diagnostics.
    *   In **medical ventilation devices**, flow sensors must possess **high dynamic range and resolution** to accommodate both infants and large adults.
    *   Ventilator flow sensors include:
        *   **Inspiratory flow sensors** (for air breathed in).
        *   **Expiratory flow sensors** (for air breathed out).
        *   **Patient's side sensors** which measure bidirectionally and account for moist air.
    *   The **Sensirion SFM 3,000 sensor** is a specific flow sensor with temperature sensors symmetrically arranged around a heating element, enabling **flow direction determination**. It operates from a 5V DC supply and has a pressure drop of only 6 millibar at flow rates up to 200 liters per minute. This sensor can also **determine the percentage mixture of two pure gases** with different specific heats, useful for gas ratios like nitrous oxide to air or helium to oxygen in a ventilator.
    *   **Ambulatory infusion pumps** for continuous liquid medicine delivery (flow rates 1 to a few hundred milliliters per hour) employ flow sensors.
    *   The **Sensirion LD20 liquid flow sensor** is installed inline with an intravenous (IV) tube to detect a drop in flow rate caused by restrictor clogging. This **thermal mass flow sensor** is isolated from the medication and can measure flow up to 1 liter per minute with a response time under 15 milliseconds. Flow rate in infusion pumps is influenced by differential pressure, height differential, medication viscosity, IV tube diameter, and the restrictor at the injection site.

### Liquid Level Detectors

*   **Function**: Determine the position of a surface inside a tank, reactor, or other vessel by measuring the **vertical distance between a reference surface and the surface of a liquid or the interface of two liquids**.
*   **Reference Surfaces**:
    *   When using **pressure sensors**, the reference surface is the **bottom of the tank**.
    *   When using **ultrasonic or radar level detectors**, the reference surface is the **top of the tank**.
*   **Applications**: Essential for **inventory management of valuable process chemicals**. The value of the fluid can be determined by multiplying the fluid level, tank surface area, fluid density, and cost per kilogram, making measurement accuracy critical.
*   **Non-Contacting Radar Level Sensors**:
    *   Offer significant advantages for measuring caustic liquid chemicals, slurries, and sludges.
    *   They have **no moving parts that can corrode**.
    *   Their accuracy is **unaffected by wide variations in temperature, pressure, fluid density, viscosity, conductivity, or caustic vapors** in the tank.

#### Principles of Operation (Pulsed Radar Level Transmitters)

*   **Pulse Emission**: Emit **narrow microwave pulses** down a cone-shaped antenna.
*   **Reflection**: Microwave signals contact the measured surface and **reflect back to the antenna**.
*   **Time of Flight**: Since the wave travels at the speed of light, reflected waves return almost immediately. For a 10-meter distance, the time of flight is approximately **6.67 x 10^-8 seconds**.
*   **Measurement Technique**: Transmitter electronics cannot measure such short times directly. Therefore, they use **Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR)** to reconstruct a waveform with a speed low enough for microprocessor measurement.
*   **Distance Calculation**: The distance (d) from the sensor to the liquid surface is calculated using the formula: **d = (t * c) / 2**, where 't' is the time of flight and 'c' is the speed of light.
*   **Liquid Level Determination**: The liquid level in the tank is found by subtracting the calculated object distance from the total tank height.
*   **Signal Loss**: Not all energy is reflected back to the antenna when the radar wave hits the liquid surface. Some energy is **transmitted through the surface into the liquid**, and other parts are **scattered at odd angles**, failing to reflect back. This is particularly true for surfaces with foam, sludges, slurries, non-flat surfaces, or agitated liquids.
*   **Reflectivity**: The reflectivity (R) of a liquid is a function of its **dielectric constant**, which is defined by its **relative permittivity (K)**. The formula for reflectivity is **R = ((sqrt(K) - 1)^2) / ((sqrt(K) + 1)^2)**.
    *   As relative permittivity (K) increases, the amount of signal reflection **increases non-linearly**.
    *   Power loss in the reflected signal also depends non-linearly on relative permittivity.
    *   Energy received back at the antenna increases as K increases.
    *   Power loss is **very high for K less than 5** but **minimal for K greater than 20**.
*   **Antenna Gain**: Reflected signal strength is affected by **signal frequency and antenna horn size**. Antenna gain (G) is calculated by **G = zeta * (pi * D / lambda)^2**, which is equivalent to **G = zeta * (pi * f * D / c)^2**.
    *   **zeta** represents efficiency, **D** is antenna diameter, **lambda** is wavelength, **f** is frequency, and **c** is the speed of light.
    *   Gain is **proportional to efficiency and to the square of the product of frequency and antenna diameter**.
*   **Signal Losses**: Signal losses are generally very large. They **increase with distance from the antenna and with a reduction in frequency**. Signal loss also **increases as antenna diameter decreases**.
*   **Frequency Trade-offs**:
    *   **High frequencies** increase antenna gain but are **absorbed to a higher degree in propagating media (including air)**, leading to a weaker return signal.
    *   In the presence of vapors or foam, **higher frequency signals experience more attenuation** than lower frequency signals.
    *   The **beam width of a radar signal is inversely proportional to frequency** for a given antenna diameter. Increasing antenna size decreases beam width and increases gain and reflected signal strength.
    *   **High frequency signals allow for a small beam angle with a relatively small antenna**.
    *   **Low frequency signals require a larger antenna** to achieve a small beam angle.
    *   A **small beam angle facilitates avoiding hidden objects** like agitators inside the tank.
    *   However, any **obstruction directly below the radar will block a narrow beam signal** entirely.
    *   The **beam angle should not be smaller than four degrees** because a smaller angle makes the installation overly sensitive to mechanical misalignment, potentially causing the reflected signal to miss the antenna and leading to an incorrect "tank dry" reading.
*   **Turbulent Surfaces**: Ripples are common during tank filling/draining. Signals hitting a turbulent surface may **scatter rather than reflect back**, reducing signal strength below measurable levels. Scatter is **minimized when the signal wavelength is larger than the ripple size**. For highly turbulent tank surfaces, a **low frequency level sensor should be used**.

#### Guided Wave Radar Level Transmitters

*   **Mechanism**: An electronics housing contains a coupler that serves as a process connection for a **probe (cable or rod)**. The probe hangs from the tank ceiling and **guides microwave energy directly to the liquid surface**.
*   **Measurement**: The transmitter sends microwave signals along the probe. When the wave reaches the liquid surface, part of the energy reflects back, while the rest enters the liquid. A receiver measures the time of flight, and electronics calculate and display the liquid level.
*   **Dual Liquid Tanks**: This technology is **optimal for tanks with two immiscible liquids**, as it can detect the **interface between them** as well as between air and the upper liquid. For example, it can measure oil floating on water; oil has lower specific gravity and relative permittivity than water.
*   **Dual-Level Measurement Process**:
    *   A microwave pulse is sent along the probe.
    *   Upon entering the upper fluid, **some energy reflects back from the air-to-upper-fluid interface** towards the coupler. The electronics measure this time lapse and calculate the upper fluid level.
    *   The remaining energy transmits through the upper fluid to the interface with the lower fluid.
    *   At a slightly later time, **reflected energy from the interface between the upper and lower fluids** reaches the coupler. The electronics calculate this interface level, accounting for the reduced speed of light using the upper fluid's relative permittivity.
*   **Limitations**: **Emulsion layers between liquids impede interface measurement**. The **MT 5,000 probe** can measure an interface level with up to a 3-inch thick emulsion layer below a 4-inch upper fluid layer. For the MT 5,000, the **upper fluid's relative permittivity must be significantly lower than the lower fluid's** (specifically, 1.4-5 for upper, >15 for lower).
*   **Specifications (MT 5,000)**: Has an LCD display for waveforms, measured level (raw counts for upper fluid), and DC voltage settings. The reference measurement is from the coupler face or mounting flange. The level signal refers to the upper fluid, and the interface signal refers to the interface between fluids. It has a measurement range of **up to 66 meters**. Accuracy for one fluid level with a coax probe is **±3 millimeters (0.005%)** at 66 meters; for two levels, it is **±25 millimeters (0.04%)** at 66 meters.

#### Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Technology

*   **Principle**: Transmits a radar signal whose **frequency increases linearly over time** (a frequency sweep).
*   **Distance Measurement**: The signal sweep reflects off the liquid surface and is received by the antenna. Because the transmitted frequency (F1) changes, the received signal (F0) has a different frequency than F1 at the same moment. The **frequency difference (delta F) between F0 and F1 is directly proportional to the distance** between the transmitter and the liquid surface.
*   **Advantages**:
    *   **More accurate signal conversion** because data is stored in the frequency domain (FM) rather than the amplitude-modulated domain (AM).
    *   **Over 30 times more sensitive than pulse radar technology**, with higher signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio.
    *   Provides a **more accurate level reading** for turbulent surfaces, surface foam, wide ambient temperature variations, and condensing vapor environments.
*   **Signal Generation**: The continuous wave signal is generated by a **voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)**. The **spectral purity of the signal is very high**, ensuring compliance with radio interference regulations.
*   **Signal Processing**: The transmitted (f1) and received (f0) signals are mixed and sent to a low-pass filter. The resulting intermediate frequency (IF) is the delta f. This delta f is then converted by a **Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)** to a frequency spectrum, from which the distance is calculated.
*   **Tank Level**: Similar to pulsed radar, the tank level is the difference between the tank height and the measured distance.

### Lidar Systems

*   **Core Principle**: Measure the distance to an object by **bouncing light off it and timing how long it takes for the light to return**. Light travels at approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second in a vacuum or air.
    *   For example, an object 5 meters in front of a car results in a 10-meter round-trip, with a delay of **33 nanoseconds**.
    *   Modern electronics, such as 1 GHz+ counters, can measure these short delays with reasonable resolution.
    *   Accuracy diminishes for shorter distances.
    *   **Triangulation methods** are an alternative for close objects, utilizing the position of a reflected spot on a linear scale when light is sent at a slight angle.
*   **Automotive Lidar Characteristics**:
    *   Most systems use **laser emitters**.
    *   Unlike a narrow "pencil-thin" beam, the laser beam is **deliberately widened to cover a larger area** for automotive applications.
    *   For instance, a SICK LMS1 lidar sensor has a beam divergence of **15 milliradians (mrad)**. At 100 meters, this translates to a 1.5-meter beam width.
    *   **Beam widening limits the total energy received** by any single detector, thereby restricting the maximum detection range for a given output power.
    *   The primary reason for a wide beam is **coverage**.
    *   Lidar systems typically **spin the laser and detector to cover a wide area**, often 360 degrees.
    *   A wider beam allows for greater angular distance between pulses without creating gaps, offering a trade-off with pulse rate and spin speed.
*   **Target Reflectivity**: This is a significant complication as reflectivity varies widely based on material, color, and surface finish.
    *   Chrome is highly reflective, while tires are poor reflectors.
    *   Smooth, shiny surfaces may reflect light in an unfavorable direction (like a mirror), reducing returned energy.
    *   Matte or rough surfaces diffuse light, which also reduces returned energy and limits range.
*   **Advantages over Human Vision**: Lidar systems can **accurately measure great distances** as long as sufficient energy is reflected. They can also **accurately detect speed** by taking repeated measurements and calculating differences, which is challenging for human eyesight, especially when objects move directly towards the observer.
*   **Detectors**:
    *   The fastest light detectors are **photodiodes**.
    *   Response times of tens of nanoseconds are required for close objects, which can limit detection speed.
    *   Fast photodiodes (responding in 1 nanosecond or less) are commercially available but are relatively expensive (e.g., >$12).
    *   High-speed photodetection electronics are complex, but specialized integrated chips are available to perform the necessary processing. An example is the ADA4330 from Analog Devices, which features a sensitive and fast front end and an SPI interface.
*   **System Complexity in Automotive Applications**:
    *   To achieve vertical coverage beyond a single line of observation, manufacturers either add a **second degree of freedom to the scan** (increasing mechanical complexity and requiring a faster pulse rate) or, more commonly, **integrate multiple laser beams and detectors that rotate together** (more expensive but provides better coverage for a given pulse rate).
    *   **Power and data transfer** to the rotating lidar system present challenges. Two primary methods are used:
        *   **Slip rings**: Good for power, but produce electronic noise and wear out over time, making them less ideal for continuous rotation.
        *   **Inductive pickup**: Requires no mechanical contact and lasts indefinitely, but transmitting high-speed data across this interface is electronically complex.
        *   A third method for signal conduction is a **mercury-based rotating coupler** (e.g., Mercotac), which operates similarly to a slip ring but uses liquid metal for lower noise.
    *   **Pitching motions of the vehicle** (during acceleration or hard braking) alter the laser beam angles relative to the road. Lidar systems must compensate by providing **sufficient vertical coverage** to accommodate these motions, which often means including additional, often unused, lasers and detectors, adding to the system cost. For example, the original Velodyne lidar system had a 26.9-degree vertical field of view achieved with multiple lasers. Alternatively, a complex and expensive servo system could maintain lidar unit level.
    *   **Multiple reflections** can occur from a single laser pulse hitting different objects at varying distances, posing a complex interpretation challenge for software algorithms. Algorithms must combine these multiple reflections from various beams to identify objects.
    *   **Data rate** is a critical issue for lidar systems, as many laser pulses must be sent and detected to form a complete image. Data must be processed at a high enough rate (e.g., a typical rate of **10 hertz**) to react to changing traffic conditions.
    *   For example, a beam width of 1.5 meters at 100 meters range would require generating and detecting **21,000 pulses per revolution** without overlap or gaps. With multiple beams for vertical coverage, data rates increase further; a Velodyne Ultra Puck can produce about **1.2 million points per second**.
    *   While modern electronics can handle this data volume, **AI algorithms are essential** for interpreting the data, identifying objects, determining their speed, and deciding on necessary vehicle actions, which is a highly complex problem requiring substantial computing power.
*   **Interference**: A significant, often overlooked, issue is **interference between multiple lidar units** on the road. With realistic, larger spot sizes, one lidar unit can "blind" another, a problem that must be addressed before widespread adoption of lidar technology.
